35294369,Machine Learning Prediction Models for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Meta-analysis,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common endocrine metabolic disease, involving a carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity during pregnancy. The incidence of GDM-related complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes has declined, in part, due to early screening. Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to identify risk factors and enable the early prediction of GDM. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis and comparison of published prognostic models for predicting the risk of GDM and identify predictors applicable to the models. Four reliable electronic databases were searched for studies that developed ML prediction models for GDM in the general population instead of among high-risk groups only. The novel Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) was used to assess the risk of bias of the ML models. The Meta-DiSc software program (version 1.4) was used to perform the meta-analysis and determination of heterogeneity. To limit the influence of heterogeneity, we also performed sensitivity analyses, a meta-regression, and subgroup analysis. A total of 25 studies that included women older than 18 years without a history of vital disease were analyzed. The pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML models predicting GDM was 0.8492; the pooled sensitivity was 0.69 (95% CI 0.68-0.69;ÊP<.001; I2=99.6%) and the pooled specificity was 0.75 (95% CI 0.75-0.75;ÊP<.001; I2=100%). As one of the most commonly employed ML methods, logistic regression achieved an overall pooled AUROC of 0.8151, while nonÐlogistic regression models performed better, with an overall pooled AUROC of 0.8891. Additionally, maternal age, family history of diabetes, BMI, and fasting blood glucose were the four most commonly used features of models established by the various feature selection methods. Compared to current screening strategies, ML methods are attractive for predicting GDM. To expand their use, the importance of quality assessments and unified diagnostic criteria should be further emphasized.","This study was a pilot meta-analysis evaluating the performance of ML models for predicting GDM. Its overall pooled estimation of 25 studies showed that ML models achieved high accuracy in early recognition of GDM patients. ML models could forecast based on data from 8 to 24 weeksÕ gestation. There was even a model that used prepregnancy features to predict the outcome up to 28 weeks in advance, suggesting the significance of ML models for GDM prediction. Compared to the census or existing screening methods, ML methods have certain advantages. Universal screening leads to 100% detection for physicians who usually make decisions based on an OGTT test, which may place an unnecessary burden on individual women and health care resources. Current selective screening strategies are based on a list of risk factors and have fixed sensitivity (±65%) and specificity (±80%). Although the ML methods do not provide greater benefit than current available screening strategies, an advantage is that a preferred trade-off between sensitivity and specificity can be selected [43]. The choice of statistical method is more to compute a quantitative measure of existing data than to predict unknown data in a general and feasible way [44]. According to the subgroup analysis, models created using non-LR methods achieved the highest AUROC, suggesting that researchers should test more candidate models. One study aimed to review and compare the predictive performances of LR and other ML algorithms for developing or validating a multivariable prognostic prediction model for pregnancy care; that study also recommended a reanalysis of existing LR models for several pregnancy outcomes by comparing them with those algorithms that apply standard guidelines [45]. Among those non-LR models, ensemble methods, like LightGBM and GA-CatBoost, that are composed of multiple weaker models and are independently trained had a satisfactory result. Variables in the GBDT model underscored the advantage of identifying nonlinear relationships. The SVM model also achieved superior outcomes; that method builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier. Methods like KNN, DT, and RF did not perform as well as the LightGBM and GA-CatBoost methods, which may be due to the fact that DT classifications are based on a single condition at the bottom, so small changes can lead to mistakes. For RF, the high dimension of medical data complicates the classification and prediction. Similarly, KNN cannot be used in high-dimensional feature spaces. Some researchers [23] found that the difference between two methods had no statistical significance, since LR models are suitable for simple data with linear relationships between variables and outcomes. Our study also found that LR models were conducive to achieving more stable performance according to the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. The subgroup of 0 to 13 weeks before diagnosis achieved the highest pooled sensitivity, while the subgroup of 14 to 28 weeks before diagnosis achieved the highest specificity, meaning that ML may assist clinicians identify more patients in early screening and avoid excessive misdiagnosis in the second trimester. The feature selection was also crucial for model performance and interpretation. Among the 25 studies, maternal age was used as a feature in 19 studies, as was previously reported and validated in our study. One of the included studies reported that the incidence of GDM increases after 25 years of age, the main reason being that the function of islet _-cells decreases with age, so the insulin antagonism of older adult pregnant women is aggravated [46]. Eight models considered GDM history to be a vital factor for predicting GDM. A DOR value of 21.09 appeared when a GDM history was included as a risk factor for predicting future GDM. Previous research discovered that women with GDM were more likely to have a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of GDM, partially due to overlapping genetic bases between the diseases [18]. The nonsignificant association of GDM with a GDM history in other studies was a result of the overwhelming proportion of nulliparous women in their studies who had no risk of developing GDM. The association between GDM and blood lipid indexes, including triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), has been studied, and TG level had the closest relationship with GDM [47]. Our research also found that although the levels of TG, total cholesterol, and LDL in the GDM group were higher than those in normal pregnant women in most included studies, only TG level was a high-risk factor of GDM after the feature selection. A novel model that included ultrasound data of maternal fat distribution and serum inflammatory factors observed that pregnant women with GDM had greater visceral fat thickness and subcutaneous fat thickness; the model also demonstrated that increased subcutaneous and visceral fat may lead to increased insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue [36]. Sweeting et al [27] observed higher leptin and lipocalin-2 levels and lower adiponectin levels in women who developed GDM and proposed adipokines as GDM features. The main strength of the study is that its methodology was logical and described in sufficient detail to be reproducible. Almost all published prognostic models for GDM were included in this meta-analysis, which enabled their comparison. The data collection table was based on the characteristics of the GDM prediction models. Additionally, the novel PROBAST was used to assess the risk of bias and applicability of prognostic prediction model studies. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool is a widely used tool for estimating the bias and applicability of primary diagnostic accuracy studies, but is not perfectly suited for predictive models [48]. An increasing number of researchers prefer the PROBAST to the QUADAS tool for assessing the bias of AI-based models in systematic reviews as well as meta-analyses; this is the case because more details of the model, such as data source, processing, number of events per variable, feature selection, model development, and model validation, were checked intensively [49-52]. We found that 14 development studies had a risk of bias in methodological quality or applicability, which may lead to overfitted prediction models. It is noteworthy that the quality of recent models is higher than that of those published earlier according to the PROBAST. Some bias could be prevented if the studies reported their research according to the TRIPOD initiative [12]. Despite our studyÕs confirmation that ML models have promising prediction ability for GDM, there are some limitations to our research. The main limitations arose from the interstudy heterogeneity. First, the sample sizes and distributions differed among studies, affecting each modelÕs performance and applicability. There were also a heterogenous variety of feature selection methods. Some researchers preferred the features that have a statistically significant association with GDM, while others included the factors based on existing knowledge from previously established models in combination with predictor reliability, consistency, applicability, availability, and cost. Second, the performance of a low-quality model might be overestimated when the analysis of the internal bias of the model is ignored. As some studies have bias to various degrees, the results of the studies in this analysis must be applied with caution. It should be noticed that the PROBAST is more likely to identify bias in prediction models than other tools designed for conventional diagnostic methods. The other limitation is that few models underwent external validation to test their extensibility. However, a previous study [8] performed an external validation of 12 published GDM prediction models and suggested that most of the published models showed acceptable discrimination and calibration, but the author pointed out possible heterogeneity in these models due to variations in GDM incidence in different populations. Although several GDM scoring systems have been developed, none are widely recommended by current guidelines. Based on the discussion above, several items must be considered in order to maximize the advantages of ML models for predicting GDM in clinical practice for model researchers or for decision makers. For the former, weÊrecommend that the decision concerning which feature selection methods and ML algorithms to use should be based on clinical need rather than accuracy. A model with excess features that are difficult to obtain in routine medicine is unlikely to be appliedÊbroadly. Researchers should also provide the process of data preprocessing and outcomes of validation, discrimination, calibration, and classification to elaborate the performance of models from multiple perspectives. For decision makers, weÊrecommend that data sources, such as a population-based cohort designed for GDM research with a unified international diagnostic criterion, promote the ML methods in this target. Studies revealed that although electronic health records provide various data, including time series and images for novel ML methods, they have inherent biases that are influenced by the interaction of the patient with the health care system. In contrast, community-based predictions may robustly capture more asymptomatic high-risk cases [53]. The incidence of GDM based on the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) (22.94%) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (21.72%) is over 3-fold higher than that based on the criteria from the 7th edition of the Chinese obstetrics and gynecology textbook (6.08%) published by the PeopleÕs Medical Publishing House [54]. Some experts in China have advocated implementation of the IADPSG criteria because they believe that it will guide researchers to better understand the prevalence of GDM in different regions and ensure that the countryÕs standards will be aligned with international ones. Nevertheless, researchers doubt that the IADPSG findings will apply to all populations, since those criteria were applied to mainly Caucasian women. All in all, it would indeed be helpful to unify the GDM diagnostic criteria as soon as possible. This meta-analysis reported the advantages of ML models and the factors requiring attention. A similar meta-analysis of ML models and deep learning algorithms used to detect patients at risk of developing diabetes reported that AI-based automated tools provide substantial benefits for reducing screening costs and can replace earlier treatments [55]. In conclusion, ML methods demonstrate high performance and will be a more selective and cost-effective screening method for GDM. The importance of quality assessment and unified diagnostic criteria should be further emphasized."
28494618,Machine Learning Methods to Predict Diabetes Complications,"One of the areas where Artificial Intelligence is having more impact is machine learning, which develops algorithms able to learn patterns and decision rules from data. Machine learning algorithms have been embedded into data mining pipelines, which can combine them with classical statistical strategies, to extract knowledge from data. Within the EU-funded MOSAIC project, a data mining pipeline has been used to derive a set of predictive models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications based on electronic health record data of nearly one thousand patients. Such pipeline comprises clinical center profiling, predictive model targeting, predictive model construction and model validation. After having dealt with missing data by means of random forest (RF) and having applied suitable strategies to handle class imbalance, we have used Logistic Regression with stepwise feature selection to predict the onset of retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy, at different time scenarios, at 3, 5, and 7 years from the first visit at the Hospital Center for Diabetes (not from the diagnosis). Considered variables are gender, age, time from diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and smoking habit. Final models, tailored in accordance with the complications, provided an accuracy up to 0.838. Different variables were selected for each complication and time scenario, leading to specialized models easy to translate to the clinical practice.","This work describes the application of a modern data mining pipeline, combining a variety of approaches to exploit clinical data to extract a risk calculator of microvascular T2DM complication. It provides a multivariate index of the patientsÕ conditions. AI-based strategies were used to handle missing data and to address class imbalance. Models were created considering different prediction horizons and validated by state-of-art data science principles. Finally, LR and nomograms was selected as the instrument to deliver the predictive models to the users. The developed pipeline allowed developing models tailored on the population characteristics, which are specific of the T2DM patients treated by the ICSM hospital. The LR model on the entire dataset, after RF imputation, identified individual risk factors for the onset of the three microvascular complications and their relative odds ratios. Hba1c, as the standard measure for blood glucose monitoring in diabetic patients, was found to be a risk factor for all complications. As the developed models take into account measurements at the first visit near the hospital, HbA1c might be affected by some bias due to poor metabolic control at the referral. However, this bias is mitigated by the very nature of the measure, which takes into account a 3-month period before the visit. In fact, HbA1c values mean (SD) of 62.42 (21.05) mmol/mol are comparable to the average values of the Italian T2DM patients.21,22 Duration of diabetes (T2DM) and BMI were found to be important risk factors for both retinopathy and neuropathy, while hypertension was found as a risk factor for both retinopathy and nephropathy. As regards of retinopathy, these results can be supported by other studies and literature reviews,23 where is shown that the main risk factors for retinopathy prevalence increasing are HbA1c and diabetes duration. Regarding nephropathy, a recent study24 applied a data mining framework to predict renal failure in T2DM on a time horizon of 5 years. The described models are based on a larger cohort and include albuminuria and creatinine values, which were not available in our analysis. The results in terms of metabolic control are comparable. Although AUC values are higher for nephropathy on a 5-year horizon, they are not significantly different from the 3-year ones, which we choose to deliver for clinical practice (as shown in table 3). the missed opportunity to include albumin-creatinine ratio indicators, which have been demonstrated to be cardiovascular risk factors,25-27 is one of the main limitations of the presented work. Models performances were evaluated in terms of MCC, which is instead dependent on the decisional threshold, which relates to how close the predicted outcome is to the actual outcome. MCC values were more informative when evaluating the impact of strategies to address the class imbalance problem: if no such strategy was adopted, the models assigned almost all examples to the majority class, leading to poor MCC results. While small differences are noticeable among resampling approaches, in general none of the proposed strategies contributed to significantly improve the AUC performances with respect to the baseline model nor achieved better MCC."
31694707,A data-driven approach to predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease with machine learning,"Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are two of the main causes of death in the United States. Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression. We evaluate the capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using survey data (and laboratory results), and identify key variables within the data contributing to these diseases among the patients. Our research explores data-driven approaches which utilize supervised machine learning models to identify patients with such diseases. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and diabetes detection. Using different time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models. The developed ensemble model for cardiovascular disease (based on 131 variables) achieved an Area Under - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) score of 83.1% using no laboratory results, and 83.9% accuracy with laboratory results. In diabetes classification (based on 123 variables), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model achieved an AU-ROC score of 86.2% (without laboratory data) and 95.7% (with laboratory data). For pre-diabetic patients, the ensemble model had the top AU-ROC score of 73.7% (without laboratory data), and for laboratory based data XGBoost performed the best at 84.4%. Top five predictors in diabetes patients were 1) waist size, 2) age, 3) self-reported weight, 4) leg length, and 5) sodium intake. For cardiovascular diseases the models identified 1) age, 2) systolic blood pressure, 3) self-reported weight, 4) occurrence of chest pain, and 5) diastolic blood pressure as key contributors. We conclude machine learned models based on survey questionnaire can provide an automated identification mechanism for patients at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We also identify key contributors to the prediction, which can be further explored for their implications on electronic health records.","Models trained on diabetic patients (Case I) generally obtain a higher predictive power (86.2%) when compared to the Case II models which has a highest recorded accuracy of 73.7%. The decrease in detection performance in comparison to Case I is primarily due to two factors Ñ 1) smaller number of observations, and 2) boundary conditions for the recorded observations. Case II only has 16,426 observations available in comparison to 21,091 observations available in Case I. The model also has difficulty in discerning fringe cases of patients, i.e. patients who are borderline diabetic versus normal. The accuracy also decreases slightly (AU-ROC at 72.5% for XGBoost) for the time-frame of 2003-2014, where there are even lower number of observations available for a larger number of variables. The consistency of the precision, recall, and F1 values suggests stable models with similar predictive power for diabetic (label=1) and non-diabetic (normal label=0) patients. The WEM and XGBoost models developed in the study surpass prior research done by Yu et al. [13] where they obtained 83.5% (Case I) and 73.2% (Case II) using non-linear SVM models. While the number of observations and additional feature variables play a key part in the increased accuracy of our models, the ensemble based model consistently out-performed SVM in the diabetic study (especially for Case I). Comparing time-frames within our data, we observe for the window of 2003-2014 the best performing model (RFC) had a lower AU-ROC score was at 84.1% for Case I. While the timeframe has a larger set of features (168 versus 123), the drop in the number of observations (16,443 versus 21,091) leads to the reduction in accuracy by 2% when compared to 1999-2014. Similar results are also observed in Case II where the AU-ROC drops by 1.2% as a result of decrease in the number from 16,446 (in 1999-2014) to 12,636 (in 2003-2014). Inclusion of laboratory results in Case I (1999-2014 timeframe) resulted in substantial increase the predictive capabilities (AU-ROC score of XGBoost - 95.7%). Contrary to previous observations, in the timeframe of 2003-2014, accuracy increases to 96.2% with XGBoost performing the best. This suggests availability of key laboratory variables within the 2003-2014 timeframe, leading to increased accuracy. Case II performance analysis with the laboratory variables also results in a large performance increase to AU-ROC score of 80.2% in the timeframe of 1999-2014 and 83.4% in 2003-2014 timeframe. XGBoost models perform the best in laboratory results in each of the cases, closely followed by the WEM model. Model performance metrics for Case I shows tree based ensemble models - Random Forest and XGBoost along with the WEM model constantly outperform linear models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. This is further highlighted in the ROC curves in Fig. 2. In Case II, the distinction is less obvious with similar performance recorded from all models as shown in Fig. 3. In such a case, computationally less demanding models such as Logistic Regression can be used to achieve similar classification performance when compared to other complex models such as SVM or ensemble classifiers. Analysis of feature variables in non-laboratory based models (within the diabetes data) shows features such as waist size, age, weight (self-reported and actual), leg-length, blood-pressure, BMI, household income, etc. contribute substantially towards the prediction of the model. This is similar to the observations and variables used in prior research [12, 13]. However, in our study we observe several dietary variables such as sodium, carbohydrate, fiber, and calcium intake contribute heavily towards diabetes detection in our models. Caffeine and alcohol consumption, along with relatives with diabetes, ethnicity, reported health condition, and high cholesterol also play key roles. Within the laboratory based data, the feature importance measures suggest blood osmolality, blood urea nitrogen content, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol are key factors in detection of diabetes. Each of the variables have been shown in prior research [30Ð33] to be key contributors or identifiers in diabetic patients. Age, waist circumference, leg length, weight, and sodium intake operate as common important variables for prediction between laboratory and survey data. Prior research in the domain of predicting diabetes have reported results with high degree of accuracy. Using a neural network based approach to predict diabetes in the Pima Indian data set, Ayon et al. [34] observed an overall F1-score of 0.99. The analysis was based on data collected only from females of Pima Indian decent, and contained plasma glucose and serum insulin (which are key indicators of diabetes) as features for prediction. In comparison, our approach is a more generalized model where the demography of the patients is not restricted and does not contain plasma glucose and serum insulin levels (even in our laboratory based models). In [35] authors compare J48, AdaboostM1, SMO, Bayes Net, and Nave Bayes, to identify diabetes based on non-invasive features. The study reports an F1 score of 0.95, and identify age as the most relevant feature in predicting diabetes, along with history of diabetes, work stress, BMI, salty food preferences, physical activity, hypertension, gender, and history of cardiovascular disease or stroke. While age, BMI, salt intake, and gender, were also identified in our study as pertinent variables, NHANES dataset does not contain (or has a high percentages of missing values) features of stress, history of cardiovascular disease, and physical activity. As a result the overall accuracy of the two studies cannot be compared directly. Heydari et al. [36] also compared SVM, artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, nearest neighbors, and Bayesian networks, with ANN reporting the highest accuracy of 98%. However, study pre-screened for type 2 diabetes and was able to collect features of family history of diabetes, and prior occurrences of diabetes, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, intake of drugs for high blood pressure, pregnancy and aborted pregnancy. Within our approach we consider both pre-diabetic and diabetic patients. Therefore, the results of this paper should be more accurate when applied to a diverse population which has not been screened for any pre-existing conditions. Model performance towards the detection of at-risk patients of cardiovascular disease was pretty consistent across all models (AU-ROC difference of 1%, Fig. 6). While the WEM performed the best (AU-ROC 83.9%), other simplistic models such as logistic regression can provide similar results. This is partly due to the lack of large number of observations in the data, with total number of samples at 8,459, and also as a result of a high degree of imbalanced data with negative (0 label) versus positive (1 label) samples at 7,012 and 1,447 respectively. The applicability of ensemble based models (WEM, RFC, and XGBoost) can be further explored in the situations where large amounts of training observations are available, but in cases with limited observations computationally simple models like Logistic Regression can be used. Models developed based on laboratory based variables do not show any significant performance gain with an increase of only 0.7%. This suggests a predictive model based on survey data only can provide an accurate automated approach towards detection of cardiovascular patients. Analyzing the features present in non-laboratory data, the most important features include age, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, self-reported greatest weight, chest pain, alcohol consumption, and family history of heart attacks among others. Incidents of chest pain, alcohol consumption, and family history of cardiac issues have been identified in prior research [37Ð39] as high risk factors for heart disease. As shown in study conducted by Lloyd-Jones et al. [40], age of the patients is a key risk variable in patients that is also identified by our models. A large number of feature importance variables are common across diabetes and cardiovascular patients, such as physical characteristics, dietary intake, and demographic characteristics. Similar factors (other than dietary variables) were identified by the study conducted by Stamler et al. [41], where they identified diabetes, age stratum, and ethnic background to be key contributors for cardiovascular disease. The laboratory based data analysis suggests features such as age, LDL and HDL cholesterol, chest pain, diastolic and systolic blood-pressure, self-reported greatest weight, calorie intake, and family history of cardiovascular problems as important variables. LDL and HDL cholesterol have been shown as high risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in prior research [42, 43]. Segmented neutrophils, monocyte, lymphocyte and eosinophilis counts recorded in the laboratory variables also have importance in this classification model. Similar to non-laboratory results, dietary variables such as calorie, carbohydrate, and calcium intake reappear in the list of important features."
33806973,Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Based on Machine Learning Algorithm,"Prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurrence allows a person at risk to take actions that can prevent onset or delay the progression of the disease. In this study, we developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict T2D occurrence in the following year (Y + 1) using variables in the current year (Y). The dataset for this study was collected at a private medical institute as electronic health records from 2013 to 2018. To construct the prediction model, key features were first selected using ANOVA tests, chi-squared tests, and recursive feature elimination methods. The resultant features were fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, triglycerides, BMI, gamma-GTP, age, uric acid, sex, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and family history. We then employed logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and ensemble machine learning algorithms based on these variables to predict the outcome as normal (non-diabetic), prediabetes, or diabetes. Based on the experimental results, the performance of the prediction model proved to be reasonably good at forecasting the occurrence of T2D in the Korean population. The model can provide clinicians and patients with valuable predictive information on the likelihood of developing T2D. The cross-validation (CV) results showed that the ensemble models had a superior performance to that of the single models. The CV performance of the prediction models was improved by incorporating more medical history from the dataset.","This study proposed a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of T2D in the following year. While previous works in [21] and [53] developed a scheme for forecasting the occurrence of diabetes, this paper dealt with the possible transition among three classes: normal, prediabetes, and diabetes. Few studies have addressed the prediction of prediabetes, as most research has been focused on the prediction of undiagnosed diabetes. In this study, a large dataset and ensemble ML techniques were employed to develop the prediction models as compared to the studies mentioned above. Furthermore, the impact of the cumulated medical data on the prediction accuracy was also presented by changing the number of years used to train the models. A data-driven feature selection was employed to find predictors that were significant for detecting the distinct classes in the dataset. The resultant 12 features were FPG, HbA1c, triglycerides, BMI, gamma-GTP, age, uric acid, sex, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and family history. FPG and HbA1c were the most important predictors based on the information-gain criteria; they were followed by gamma-GTP, BMI, triglycerides, and age. Compared to using the traditional five predictors of T2D (FPG, HbA1c, BMI, age, and sex), the proposed models employing the selected features showed a superior prediction performance. When four years of data were utilized in training, the maximum CV accuracy was 81% for the selected features and 77% for the traditional features. It can be concluded that the additional seven features contributed to improved accuracy of prediction. We also note that in addition to the traditional predictors, clinicians must pay attention to the changes in gamma-GTP, uric acid, and triglycerides over the years. The study presented in [5] reported the application of an ML model to identify the occurrence of prediabetes in advance. In their study, they have indicated the difficulties of predicting the prediabetes condition. The best accuracy presented was 69.9% for the KNHANES dataset. Our experimental results have shown a better prediction performance in predicting the occurrence of not only diabetes and normal but also the prediabetes condition too. The highest CV classification accuracy observed was 78% by using last yearÕs medical records as training data. However, the performance of the prediction model was improved by increasing the number of years to train the models. The study presented in [53] reported a comparison of three data mining models for predicting diabetes or prediabetes by risk factors. The dataset for the study was collected from two communities in Guangzhou, China: 735 patients confirmed to have diabetes or prediabetes and 752 normal controls. The risk factors (predictors) used were age, family history of diabetes, marital status, education level, work stress, duration of sleep, physical activity, preference for salty food, gender, eating fish, drinking coffee, and body mass index. Three ML algorithms: logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and decision tree models were employed for predicting diabetes or prediabetes using the predictors. The decision tree model (C5.0) had the best classification accuracy (77.87%), followed by the logistic regression model (76.13%), and the ANN gave the lowest accuracy (73.23%). LR, RF, SVM, XGBoost, CIM, stacking classifier, and soft voting algorithms were utilized to generate the prediction models. Experimental results showed that the generated prediction models performed slightly better than the LR model, the existing statistical analysis method. However, the performance difference among the algorithms was negligible on the test data. This can be explained by class overlap in the feature space. The prediabetes class especially had a high degree of class overlap with normal and diabetes classes. The confusion matrix results confirmed that most of the prediction errors were from the prediabetes class. This lowered the overall performance of the prediction models and limited the maximum accuracy to 73%. The CV results showed a significant performance difference among the prediction models. The ensemble models (CIM, ST, and SV) had a superior CV performance to that of the single models including LR. The CV performance of the prediction models was improved by incorporating more medical history from the dataset. Overall, the results of the present study demonstrated that the generated prediction models performed better than the existing clinical screening model (LR). The application of the developed prediction models and findings of this study redound to the benefit of both clinicians and patients. The models can be used as viable support in clinical decision-making and patient counseling for practitioners. Furthermore, early prediction of the disease enables diabetes patients and those at risk for diabetes to take preventive measures that can delay the progression of the disease and its life-threatening complications. This study has certain limitations. First, FPG level was the only measurement that was used to define normal, prediabetes, and diabetes; HbA1c and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were not taken into consideration. However, the use of FPG level was consistent with the model developed by [5,54]. Second, in this study 10-fold cross-validation was utilized in the evaluation of the models. However, the development and validation of the models were conducted with only one dataset. Thus, it is compulsory to utilize additional data sources to verify the models derived in this study. Our study suggests two additional investigations that are worth pursuing. The first would be to incorporate diverse datasets to mitigate the difficulty of classifying prediabetes, which stems from the overlap with normal and diabetes classes. The second would be to increase the accessibility of the prediction models and improve the user experience for web and mobile applications."
35392258,Use of Machine Learning and Routine Laboratory Tests for Diabetes Mellitus Screening,"Most patients with diabetes mellitus are asymptomatic, which leads to delayed and more complex treatment. At the same time, most individuals are routinely subjected to standard clinical laboratory examinations, which create large health datasets over a lifetime. Computer processing has been used to search for health anomalies and predict diseases using clinical examinations. This work studied machine learning models to support the screening of diabetes through routine laboratory tests using data from laboratory tests of 62,496 patients. The classification and regression models used were the K-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, Bayes nave, random forest models, and artificial neural networks. Glycated hemoglobin, a test used for diabetes diagnosis, was used as the target. Regression models calculated glycated hemoglobin directly and were later classified. The performance of classification computer models has been studied under various subdataset partitions and combinations (e.g., healthy, prediabetic, and diabetes, as well as no healthy and no diabetes). The best single performance was achieved with the artificial neural network model when detecting prediabetes or diabetes. The artificial neural network classification model scored 78.1%, 78.7%, and 78.4% for sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores, respectively, when identifying no healthy group. Other models also had good results, depending on what is desired. Machine learning-based models can predict glycated hemoglobin values from routine laboratory tests and can be used as a screening tool to refer a patient for further testing.","We studied a machine learning approach to detect DM using data from the most frequently performed clinical laboratory examinations. Glycated hemoglobin was used as a model target. Clinical laboratory data are often available because they are typically generated from routine blood tests. We demonstrated that machine learning could assist in the detection of DM. This system can be implemented at a minimal cost, as data are already available on computer databases from routine examinations. The proposed approach alone is not recommended for diagnostic purposes. We recommend using the system to generate an alert and recommend a specific DM examination. Thus, the models would improve DM investigation processes, as patients diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes could be referred for further analysis, which is compatible with intelligent health systems [40]. If a patient laboratory log shows diabetes probability, i.e., a Òdiabetes-likeÓ pattern, the system can recommend further diabetes examination. The patients with Òdiabetes patternsÓ should be guided to traditional examinations and procedures. HbA1c strongly correlates with the average glucose [41], being more stable and recommended for diabetes diagnoses [42]. Thus, during the FPG analysis process, the system will be able to predict HbA1c values over different arrangements of datasets, looking for some kind of discrepancy in relation to the exam performed. If there is a difference between the results, a new FPG test or a supplementary HbA1c test may be recommended in order to obtain a counter-proof of the result. As it is a computational method, there is no interruption in traditional procedures. The system can collaborate synergistically with the current procedure and may collaborate to detect DM earlier. Currently, some studies have used laboratory tests to predict new results and support the diagnosis of diseases that are not the target of the test, as in Park's study [34], where several diseases are predicted. The most recent reports were [43Ð46], which studied the prediction of the RT-PCR test. However, several studies have used other types of data and machine learning techniques to assist DM prediction. In a study by Zheng et al. [47], the authors obtained 100% sensitivity and precision above 90% in several models while using a dataset of 300 samples and used several categories of features, including self-reporting notes and medication. Oliveira et al. [48] obtained 68% sensitivity and 68% specificity after using a smaller dataset and categorical features obtained through interviews. Lai et al. [16] obtained 71.6% sensitivity and 73.4% specificity with a dataset of 13,309 samples using laboratory and clinical features. The results obtained in this study cannot be directly compared to those of the studies mentioned above because the methodologies and features (i.e., input parameters and hyperparameters) differ. This study used only quantitative data from routine laboratory tests to train different classification and regression models, as well as different dataset arrangements, having an exploratory character. A confusion matrix was chosen for the evaluation of the overall model. The confusion matrix is particularly useful when working with unbalanced data. The values of the main diagonal of the confusion matrix make up the accuracy, which is not a good evaluation metric in classification models with unbalanced datasets. In these cases, the F1 score is the most recommended evaluation metric. This F1 score represents a consonant mean between sensitivity and precision and is a simple way to evaluate models with unbalanced databases. However, the most appropriate metric to evaluate a classification model in searching for a target is the joint analysis of sensitivity and precision. For instance, high-sensitivity models are better for target identification (e.g., RF model for HN dataset, Table 3). Therefore, prioritizing models with high precision (e.g., KNN model for ND dataset, Table 3) will provide greater certainty in the results. When using the classification models (see Table 2), we found that the ANN model had the highest sensitivity in identifying DM (66.2%), with a precision of 84.9%. The same occurred in identifying patients with prediabetes, where the ANN model had the best sensitivity (67.9%). The KNN model, on the other hand, obtained the highest precision in the identification of DM (89.1%), despite the low sensitivity (47.0%). For the identification of healthy individuals, the NB model had the highest sensitivity (79.4%), followed by the SVM and RF models (79.2% for both). The highest precision was for the ANN model (76.9%), followed by the SVM and RF models (74.2% for both). Regarding the F1 score, we found that the ANN model had the highest results for all classes (i.e., 74.4% for diabetes, 64.9% for prediabetes, and 76.7% for healthy). When using the regression models, we verified the capacity of the models in predicting HbA1c, as shown in the scatter plot in Figure 5. ANNr yielded the best result, with an MSE of 0.29. However, the graph shows that all models were able to predict HbA1c. Subsequently, the predicted value of HbA1c was classified as DM status according to [36], which may lead to some classification errors when HbA1c values are close to the transition limits between the different classes. This fuzzy range in the classification of regression values is proportional to the mean absolute error (MAS) of approximately 0.33 for all tested models. Comparing the values in Tables _Tables44 and _and5,5, we observe a certain similarity of the classification results after regression with the results of the classification models. This similarity was also observed by examining the confusion matrix (Figures _(Figures33 and _and6).6). Among the different models and datasets, a slight variation in the results was observed; in some cases, the classification of regression values was better than that of the classification models. Figures _Figures33 and _and66 show that all models misclassified (by more than 30%) prediabetes cases as healthy cases. Thus, according to the classification of the models, patients with prediabetes are more ÒsimilarÓ to healthy individuals than patients with DM. We can further analyze the prediabetic classification characteristics using the HN and ND datasets. In Table 3, we observe that the ANN model performed better using the HN dataset (where prediabetes and DM are in the same class), with a sensitivity of 78.1% and precision of 78.7%. This arrangement is interesting in the search for unhealthy individuals and can be used in general to screen patients who already have or are on the way to developing the disease. However, regarding the sensitivity and precision using the ND dataset (where healthy and prediabetic individuals are in the same class), we observed variations in the performance of the models. All models have lower sensitivity but higher precision values than the HN dataset. According to the F1 score, the regression model that classified better patients with diabetes and prediabetes was SVMr, reaching 74.9% and 61.1%, respectively. The model with the best performance in classifying healthy patients was ANNr (77.2%). The greater precision of the models in the ND dataset reinforces the idea that prediabetes patients are more similar to healthy individuals than they are to patients with diabetes. Depending on the objective, a dataset arrangement of HN or ND can be used. For instance, precision is more important than sensitivity when screening for false negatives, which would lead us to use the ND arrangement. Only the results with a negative diagnosis would be analyzed in this case. Even if the system is not very sensitive, it must have high precision. Thus, even if a few cases of false negatives are identified, we will be more confident that these cases are real false negatives. In this sense, we draw attention to the KNN classification model. Using this model in the search for false negatives, even if it only identifies half of the occurrences, we will be 94% sure that these tests are false negatives. In the search for the correct classification of diabetes or no healthy patients, we understand that the idea is to have high sensitivity and precise models, which means fewer false positives. We demonstrate that machine learning can detect DM using data from laboratory examinations performed most frequently. The model achieved better results as the sensitivity increased; however, sensitivity was less important than precision. The artificial neural network classification model scored 78.1%, 78.7%, and 78.4% for sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores, respectively, when identifying no healthy individuals (i.e., individuals with prediabetes or diabetes). Thus, we believe that this approach exhibits the best overall performance. We observed that all tested models had difficulty classifying the prediabetes group; thus, the dataset configuration improved detection. This model may use existing laboratory examinations of patients to recommend further and specific DM follow-up. Thus, these results could support the screening of DM using machine learning algorithms and available clinical information."
35429810,Diabetes mellitus prediction and diagnosis from a data preprocessing and machine learning perspective,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, which results from the inadequacy of the body to secrete and respond to insulin. If not properly managed or diagnosed on time, diabetes can pose a risk to vital body organs such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels and so can be life-threatening. The many years of research in computational diagnosis of diabetes have pointed to machine learning to as a viable solution for the prediction of diabetes. However, the accuracy rate to date suggests that there is still much room for improvement. In this paper, we are proposing a machine learning framework for diabetes prediction and diagnosis using the PIMA Indian dataset and the laboratory of the Medical City Hospital (LMCH) diabetes dataset. We hypothesize that adopting feature selection and missing value imputation methods can scale up the performance of classification models in diabetes prediction and diagnosis. In this paper, a robust framework for building a diabetes prediction model to aid in the clinical diagnosis of diabetes is proposed. The framework includes the adoption of Spearman correlation and polynomial regression for feature selection and missing value imputation, respectively, from a perspective that strengthens their performances. Further, different supervised machine learning models, the random forest (RF) model, support vector machine (SVM) model, and our designed twice-growth deep neural network (2GDNN) model are proposed for classification. The models are optimized by tuning the hyperparameters of the models using grid search and repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation and evaluated for their ability to scale to the prediction problem. Through experiments on the PIMA Indian and LMCH diabetes datasets, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, train-accuracy, and test-accuracy scores of 97.34%, 97.24%, 97.26%, 99.01%, 97.25 and 97.28%, 97.33%, 97.27%, 99.57%, 97.33, are achieved with the proposed 2GDNN model, respectively. The data preprocessing approaches and the classifiers with hyperparameter optimization proposed within the machine learning framework yield a robust machine learning model that outperforms state-of-the-art results in diabetes mellitus prediction and diagnosis. The source code for the models of the proposed machine learning framework has been made publicly available.","The PIMA Indian diabetes dataset contains information of 768 women from a population near Phoenix, Arizona, in the USA. The dataset can be assumed to yield gestational diabetes information because there are pregnant women represented. On the other hand, the LMCH dataset comprises 1000 patients of Iraqi national patients, and though a more recent dataset it still does not address some of the limitations of the PIMA Indian dataset as only adult male and female patients information are presented. As such, there is a need for a representation that cuts across men, women (who are either pregnant or not), as well as children, and especially people of African descent, who are more at risk of developing diabetes. This is to enable the proposed model to generalize well to a wider diabetes population. To address this limitation, we propose to expand the scope of the study beyond the PIMA Indian and LMCH datasets and engage in unbiased diabetes data collection. Then, investigate the generalizability of the proposed ML framework in comparison to other machine learning algorithms on the collected data. The goal will be to develop a healthcare solution that meets the individualized diabetes diagnosis need of patients, irrespective of gender, age, or race."
35663304,Identification and Verification of Diagnostic Biomarkers for Glomerular Injury in Diabetic Nephropathy Based on Machine Learning Algorithms,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is regarded as the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide and lacks novel therapeutic targets. To screen and verify special biomarkers for glomerular injury in patients with DN, fifteen datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, correspondingly divided into training and testing cohorts and then merged. Using the limma package, 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out between 81 glomerular DN samples and 41 normal ones from the training cohort. With the help of the ConsensusClusterPlus and WGCNA packages, the 81 glomerular DN samples were distinctly divided into two subclusters, and two highly associated modules were identified. By using machine learning algorithms (LASSO, RF, and SVM-RFE) and the Venn diagram, two overlapping genes (PRKAR2B and TGFBI) were finally determined as potential biomarkers, which were further validated in external testing datasets and the HFD/STZ-induced mouse models. Based on the biomarkers, the diagnostic model was developed with reliable predictive ability for diabetic glomerular injury. Enrichment analyses indicated the apparent abnormal immune status in patients with DN, and the two biomarkers played an important role in the immune microenvironment. The identified biomarkers demonstrated a meaningful correlation between the immune cells' infiltration and renal function. In conclusion, two robust genes were identified as diagnostic biomarkers and may serve as potential targets for therapeutics of DN, which were closely associated with multiple immune cells.","Diabetic nephropathy results from the interactions of multiple genes. However, its potential mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, a large number of studies have focused on the screening of related biomarkers. Wang et al. analyzed five DN-associated gene datasets and identified fibronectin 1 (FN1) and complement component 3 (C3) as the immune infiltration-related biomarkers for DN (19). Wang et al. revealed the different pathological abnormalities between glomerulus and kidney tubules in DN and indicated that the changes of key regulated genes in methylation status might contribute to the pathogenesis of DN (20). However, although many efforts have been made to explore novel targets for DN, the present knowledge seems to be insufficient. Potential biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity are still urgently required. PRKAR2B is a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (21) regulatory subunit that is abundantly expressed in various tumor tissues (22). However, there are few studies on the role of PRKAR2B in the progression of DN. Our study identified that PRKAR2B, with an excellent diagnostic value (AUC >0.95), was downregulated in the glomerulus but there was no significant change in the tubulointerstitium. TGFBI is a secretory protein induced by TGF-_ in various cells and can be detected in serum and urine (23, 24). It was demonstrated that TGFBI was involved in the fibrotic processes of chronic cyclosporine-induced nephropathy by affecting the synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix (25). In the present study, the expression of TGFBI was upregulated in both glomerular and tubulointerstitial tissues, and it was proved to have a reliable diagnostic ability for DN. It was reported that the expression of TGFBI was prominently increased in the kidneys of diabetic patients, whereas the concentration of TGFBI in urine was also raised (26). Elevated urinary TGFBI concentration has been shown to predict the prognosis of DN (27). This evidence enhanced the accessibility and feasibility of the clinical applications of TGFBI as a diagnostic marker. However, it is unclear why there was no significant correlation between TGFB expression in glomerular tissue and renal function indexes (such as GFR and Scr) in DN patients. Most notably, a novel diagnostic model combining the two biomarkers was developed with a high AUC value and favorable calibration, which exhibited excellent accuracy and reliability for estimating the glomerular damage in DN patients. Compared with any other single biomarker, the above model showed the highest efficacy for glomerular injury prediction in the GDN training cohort. In this study, we found that the downregulated PRKAR2B expression in glomerular tissue may indicate the deterioration of kidney function in patients with DN, and so did the upregulated TGFBI in tubulointerstitial tissue. However, similar expression patterns of PRKAR2B and TGFBI were also found in patients with HN or SLEN, which suggested the differential expressions of PRKAR2B and TGFBI were not specific for DN but related to the renal injury. It had been reported that extracellular matrix organization and extracellular matrix structural constituent lead to the accelerated deposition of extracellular matrix and renal fibrosis in DN (28). In this study, DEGs were demonstrated to be involved in this process in DN glomerular tissue. Multiple metabolism-related pathways were mainly enriched in normal samples, while immune inflammation pathways were mostly concentrated in GDN samples. It confirmed the notion that metabolic disorders and abnormal immune inflammation responses play a critical role in DN (29). Meanwhile, both PRKAR2B and TGFBI were disclosed to be involved in immune-related pathways and cell functions in the glomerular injury of DN. Moreover, both of them were associated with various immune cells such as nave B cells, gamma delta T cells, Tregs, resting NK cells, resting mast cells, and macrophages. Previous studies reported that the deposition of macrophages, an important feature of DN, could be discovered in the kidney tissue of DN patients, indicating a decline in renal function (30). Mast cells were reported to participate in renal interstitial fibrosis, and the density of mast cells was related to serum creatinine levels in DN (31). It was reported that increased Tregs contributed to the improvement of DN and promoted the transplant tolerance to DN-induced renal allografts (32, 33). However, the roles of nave B cells and gamma delta T cells in the pathological processes of DN have not been reported. Overall, the infiltrating immune cells are involved in the development and progression of DN. Improving abnormal immune status by targeting PRKAR2B and TGFBI may be a promising approach for the treatment of DN. Some limitations need to be considered. First, different pathological stages of DN may affect the results of the study. Second, because of the potential heterogeneity from different annotation platforms and clinical covariates of samples, the batch effects cannot be completely eliminated among datasets. Third, the sample size may not be large enough. Finally, the present study was based on public data, so the biological functions of the two biomarkers need to be verified by further experiments. In this study, using WGCNA, LASSO, SVM-RFE, and RF algorithms, PRKAR2B and TGFBI were identified as the potential biomarkers of DN. A diagnostic model combining PRKAR2B and TGFBI was established to evaluate the risk of diabetic glomerular injury with high sensitivity and accuracy. The potential association with infiltrating immune cells was also demonstrated, providing a fresh perspective on their roles in DN. Therefore, the findings may shed light on the management and treatment of patients with DN."
36964219,Machine learning for post-acute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus prediction and personalized treatment recommendations,"Post-acute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM-A) is the main component of pancreatic exocrine diabetes mellitus. Timely diagnosis of PPDM-A improves patient outcomes and the mitigation of burdens and costs. We aimed to determine risk factors prospectively and predictors of PPDM-A in China, focusing on giving personalized treatment recommendations. Here, we identify and evaluate the best set of predictors of PPDM-A prospectively using retrospective data from 820 patients with acute pancreatitis at four centers by machine learning approaches. We used the L1 regularized logistic regression model to diagnose early PPDM-A via nine clinical variables identified as the best predictors. The model performed well, obtaining the best AUC = 0.819 and F1 = 0.357 in the test set. We interpreted and personalized the model through nomograms and Shapley values. Our model can accurately predict the occurrence of PPDM-A based on just nine clinical pieces of information and allows for early intervention in potential PPDM-A patients through personalized analysis. Future retrospective and prospective studies with multicentre, large sample populations are needed to assess the actual clinical value of the model.","PPDM-A is the most common sequela of pancreatitis11,17,18, and is characterized by poorer glycaemic control, a higher risk of developing cancer, and a higher risk of mortality10,19Ð21. However, the pathogenesis of diabetes secondary to acute pancreatitis is convoluted, which makes early clinical identification challenging. In addition, there is still no good classification model to predict PPDM-A in advance. Our feature contribution analysis prompted us to try to build a simpler predictive model based on a minimum number of the most influential features. To this end, we could fully evaluate the modelÕs performance using only nine pieces of information obtained about the patient. This study examined the ability to use nine clinical features to predict PPDM-A, leading to early intervention and effective PPDM-A screening. Our results suggest that clinical features can accurately predict the risk of PPDM-A after the onset of acute pancreatitis, although none of the nine clinical features we included directly reflected islet cell function. The findings reveal that indicators related to pancreatic injury (APFC, PPC, ANC, WON, amylase) affected the predicted outcome during the feature selection process, consistent with previous studies22,23. However, growing evidence compels a reconsideration of the dogma: Ò_-cell destruction is the only underlying mechanism of diabetes after acute pancreatitisÓ. Our study reveals that age, BMI, metabolic status, and comorbidities play different roles in individuals and may lead to opposite outcomes. It may be due to the mutual influence of organs on each other in the case of imbalanced glucose metabolism24Ð26. We assessed the characteristics that had the most profound impact on the model's predictions by Shapley value. We found that admission glucose, obesity (BMI_>_28 kg/m2), and HDL-C_<_1.03 mmol /l were the three factors that had the most significant impact on the outcome, and this result is consistent with the results of feature extraction. Prior studies also have demonstrated that hyperglycemia during hospitalization of acute critical illness is associated with emergent diabetes and identifying patients for subsequent diabetes screening. In a Scottish retrospective cohort study, 2.3% of patients with an emergency admission to a hospital without previously known diabetes were newly diagnosed with diabetes within 3-years27. In a nationwide national cohort of consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction without known diabetes, hyperglycemia at admission was significantly associated with subsequent diabetes (odds ratio: 2.56; 95% CI 2.15Ð3.06)28. Furthermore, changes in lipid metabolism and abnormal distribution of abdominal adipose tissue are significantly associated with PPDM-A. Our work has several clinical applications. Firstly, it can facilitate early intervention in patients at high risk of diabetes. Early intervention for the development of diabetes is not currently studied. However, based on the health management knowledge of type 2 diabetes29Ð32, we can assume that a combination of diet and exercise can significantly decrease the incidence of diabetes. Due to the low prevalence of PPDM-A, early analysis of the effectiveness of prevention strategies can present some challenges. Our model can identify and recruit people at high risk of developing PPDM-A above 70%. Therefore, the current study paves the way for future randomized controlled trials to investigate further the effectiveness of using the model for early prediction of PPDM-A and possible prevention interventions. Another influential application is to help construct effective screening methods for PPDM-A. The prevalence of PPDM-A can already be confirmed considerably by admission glucose, BMI metrics, and HDL-C at the onset of acute pancreatitis. This staged risk assessment model can be used in subsequent studies to construct more rational design protocols for prospective studies of PPDM-A. Finally, by using the Sharpely Value, we can predict the likelihood of PPDM-A occurring in patients and identify key causative factors that can be targeted to give personalized treatment recommendations."
33406038,Skin Complications of Diabetes Mellitus Revealed by Polarized Hyperspectral Imaging and Machine Learning,"Aging and diabetes lead to protein glycation and cause dysfunction of collagen-containing tissues. The accompanying structural and functional changes of collagen significantly contribute to the development of various pathological malformations affecting the skin, blood vessels, and nerves, causing a number of complications, increasing disability risks and threat to life. In fact, no methods of non-invasive assessment of glycation and associated metabolic processes in biotissues or prediction of possible skin complications, e.g., ulcers, currently exist for endocrinologists and clinical diagnosis. In this publication, utilizing emerging photonics-based technology, innovative solutions in machine learning, and definitive physiological characteristics, we introduce a diagnostic approach capable of evaluating the skin complications of diabetes mellitus at the very earlier stage. The results of the feasibility studies, as well as the actual tests on patients with diabetes and healthy volunteers, clearly show the ability of the approach to differentiate diabetic and control groups. Furthermore, the developed in-house polarization-based hyperspectral imaging technique accomplished with the implementation of the artificial neural network provides new horizons in the study and diagnosis of age-related diseases.","The developed hyperspectral system has shown the ability to sense the alterations of blood content, blood oxygenation, and collagen structure in human skin in vivo. The implementation of the ANN-based processing allows for fast recovery of the considered skin parameters. Our concept was successfully demonstrated in preclinical experiments and clinical studies and satisfied the major requirements for modern medical imaging techniques by providing: high FOV, high spectral resolution, close to real-time data acquisition and processing, high level of sensitivity and specificity. This is the first in vivo human clinical study to report a label-free, non-invasive polarization-sensitive approach that can discriminate between the skin of DM patients and control participants. We showed that polarization-enhanced hyperspectral analysis can differentiate the skin tissue with age-related and DM changes. We assume that the shown differences in the PI parameter, characterizing the age-related collagen changes, can form the basis for the diagnosis of DM complications. Prediction of ulcers can also be based on the detection of changes in collagen structure. Fig. 6d shows the absence of correlation between the age of the patients with diabetes and PI. In the same time, a significant correlation is observed for the control group of healthy volunteers. It can be explained by the fact that the presence of diabetes can distort the collagen structure at any age and thus hinders the dependence of PI on the age for diabetic group. That, in particular, supports our suggestion of the sensitivity of PI to the changes in collagen structure that is altered in the presence of diabetes (Fig. 6a). It should be borne in mind that the blood content in the biotissue, epidermis thickness, and some other factors may specifically affect the residual polarization spectra. Thus, hyperspectral polarization imaging, in contrast to the standard approach with the registration of reflected light, allows for more detailed tissue analysis, including selectively tracking changes in the concentration of various absorbers and scatterers in the biotissue. Nonetheless, for future clinical applications, our technique can be improved and expanded. The developed data processing algorithm allows almost real-time processing of the hyperspectral images, however, the time of the hypercube acquisition and the duration of the data transfer via USB port impose the main limitation on the system performance. The hyperspectral sensor with specific spectral resolution and wavelength range could be flexibly optimised according to application requirements. In this study, a spectral band of 510Ð900 nm was utilized. However, the application of a sensor with an extended spectral range up to 1000 nm may provide an additional possibility to analyze the content of water and fat in tissues. Additionally, the use of UV or blue sources in the lighting channel will allow the HSI method to be used for the fluorescence analysis of AGEs, as well as the respiratory chain coenzymes NADH and FAD [60], [61]. There is also further potential to expand the number of clinical investigations that will eventually allow the methods in question to be introduced into the practice of the attending physician. In summary, we have developed a compact HSI system utilizing ANN-based processing approach for the calculation of distribution maps of skin blood content, blood oxygenation, and the polarization index of the reflected radiation. The proposed system is capable of close to real-time hyperspectral image processing. The use of polarization-sensitive hyperspectral imaging and parameters of BVF, SBO, and PI in combination or individually can have important clinical applications since they can help to identify patients with different degrees of microcirculation impairments in the lower extremities. The proposed parameters could serve as biomarkers of diabetic complications. They can also be used to evaluate therapeutic procedures aimed at preventing or reversing diabetic complications. Employment of the PI parameter increases the sensitivity and specificity of the method up to the level of 95% and 85%, respectively, compared to the approach that relies only on BVF and SBO (sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%). Our results can facilitate the development of the HIS technique and give a new direction in the studies of age-related diseases."
35463255,A Novel Approach for Feature Selection and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus: Machine Learning Methods,"An active research area where the experts from the medical field are trying to envisage the problem with more accuracy is diabetes prediction. Surveys conducted by WHO have shown a remarkable increase in the diabetic patients. Diabetes generally remains in dormant mode and it boosts the other diseases if patients are diagnosed with some other disease such as damage to the kidney vessels, problems in retina of the eye, and cardiac problem; if unidentified, it can create metabolic disorders and too many complications in the body. The main objective of our study is to draw a comparative study of different classifiers and feature selection methods to predict the diabetes with greater accuracy. In this paper, we have studied multilayer perceptron, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, and random forest classifiers and few feature selection techniques were applied on the classifiers to detect the diabetes at an early stage. Raw data is subjected to preprocessing techniques, thus removing outliers and imputing missing values by mean and then in the end hyperparameters optimization. Experiments were conducted on PIMA Indians diabetes dataset using Weka 3.9 and the accuracy achieved for multilayer perceptron is 77.60%, for decision trees is 76.07%, for K-nearest neighbour is 78.58%, and for random forest isÊ79.8%, which is by far the best accuracy for random forest classifier.","We made use of PIMA Indians diabetes dataset whose distribution is shown in Figures 3(a)Ð3(f) downloaded from Kaggle and is available publicly on UCI repository. It contains data of 768 pregnant female patients, amongst which 268 were diabetic and 500 were nondiabetic. There were 9 variables present inside the dataset; eight variables contain information about patients, and the 9th variable is the class predicting the patients as diabetic and nondiabetic. The dataset consisted of outliers and missing values. In our proposed method, we have detected the outliers and removed them from the dataset. Missing values which were present inside the dataset were imputed using mean filter approach, thus leaving the dataset in a consistent state. All the experiments were done using Weka 3.9.4. The description of the dataset is shown in Table 2. We used correlation attribute, information gain, and principal component analysis method to identify relevant features from the dataset. The results of feature selection are shown in Table 3 with 4 features and 6 features. Once the feature selection and number of features are identified, we can continue with identified feature selection method, that is, corelation attribute selection, and the number of features selected for classification is six. The results after feature selection methodologies are shown in Table 3. After feature selection, outliers were removed, missing values were imputed, and parameters were optimized. Optimization of parameters is shown in Table 1. After applying the proposed method, we have investigated that decision trees yield an accuracy of 76.07, random forest yielded 79.8, multilayer perceptron yielded 77.60, and K-nearest neighbour yielded 78.58. The performance parameters analyzed are sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, and area under the curve. After the application of the proposed method, we can see the remarkable increase in the accuracy and the comparison is shown in Figures _Figures44 and _and55 and Table 4 as well. Various techniques have been proposed in the past related to the classification of diabetes and the comparative analysis is shown in Table 5. Li et al. [39] proposed an ensemble of support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and Nave Bayes method with taking all the features. The authors did not apply any preprocessing techniques and the ensemble of classifiers was done on raw data, thus achieving an accuracy of 58.3%. Self-organizing maps were used by Deng and Kasabov [40] and the dataset was subjected to 10-fold cross-validation protocol and achieved the classification accuracy of 78.4%. Sisodia et al. applied decision trees, support vector machines, and Nave Bayes classifiers to predict the diabetes and in their method Nave Bayes outshone the other methods and the classification accuracy achieved was 76.3%. Smith et al. [41] divided the dataset into training and testing datasets, where 75% of the data were taken for training and the remaining 25% were taken for testing, and they applied ADAP neural network algorithm to achieve the accuracy of 76%. Hasan et al. took six and four features into consideration and, after application of feature selection and data preprocessing technique, an ensemble of AdaBoost and extreme Gradient boost was applied on PIMA Indians diabetes dataset to classify the data into diabetic and nondiabetic and the accuracy achieved was 78.9%. Quinlan et al. [42] applied C4.5 decision tree algorithm for classification of diabetic patients and hence achieved accuracy of 71.10%. Bozkurt et al. [43] applied artificial neural network to achieve the classification accuracy of 76%. Parashar et al. [44] achieved the classification accuracy of 77.60% by application of linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. Sahan et al. [45] achieved the accuracy of 75.87% by applying artificial immune system. Chatreti et al. proposed the implementation of discriminant analysis and achieved the accuracy of 72%. Chatrati et al. [47] removed the missing values, therefore reducing the dataset to 460 values from which 200 observations were taken as training dataset and 260 were taken as testing dataset, thus achieving the accuracy of 78%. The evaluation parameters for the classifiers are shown in Table 6 which clearly shows that random forest classifier gives the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, while the multilayer perceptron gives the highest area under the curve. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) plots the graph of sensitivity versus 1 _ specificity. The focus of our study covered the comprehensive analysis of three feature selection methods, that is, correlation attribute evaluation, information gain, and principal component analysis, further comparing four classifiers, that is, K-nearest neighbour, decision trees, random forest, and multilayer perceptron, thus improving accuracy by preprocessing and optimizing few hyperparameters. Finally, the performances of the classifiers were evaluated using evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy and we have shown that random forest gives highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. We have got encouraging results when compared against K-nearest neighbour, decision trees, and multilayer perceptron. The limitation of this model is that specificity achieved is not satisfactory."
34631003,Machine Learning Based Diabetes Classification and Prediction for Healthcare Applications,"The remarkable advancements in biotechnology and public healthcare infrastructures have led to a momentous production of critical and sensitive healthcare data. By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications.","Different baseline studies have been implemented and compared with the proposed system to verify the performance of the proposed diabetes classification and prediction system. Mainly, we focus on those studies that used the PIMA dataset. First, we compare the state-of-the-art diabetes classification techniques with the proposed technique. All the baseline techniques [17Ð19] used the PIMA dataset and the same evaluation measures used in this study. In particular, the authors compared nave Bayes [17], PCA_CVR (classification via regression) [18], and SVM [19] with different machine learning techniques for diabetes classification. However, the proposed fine-tuned MLP-based diabetes classification technique outperformed as compared to baseline studies, as shown in Figure 8. Several attempts have also been made in the literature for diabetic prediction due to its importance in real life. For this comparison, we have chosen the most recent and state-of-the-art techniques. We compare the proposed system performance with the recent state-of-the-art systems [60Ð65], as shown in Figure 9 and Table 7. The proposed method outperformed as compared to state-of-the-art systems with an accuracy of 87.26%, all the compared systems evaluated on the PID with the same experimental setup. This study has also proposed the architecture of a hypothetical diabetic monitoring system for diabetic patients. The proposed hypothetical system will enable a patient to control, monitor, and manage their chronic conditions in a better way at their homes. The monitoring system will store the health activities and create interaction between patients, smartphones, sensor medical devices, web servers, and medical teams by providing a platform having wireless communication devices, as shown inÊFigure 10. The central theme of the proposed healthcare monitoring system is the collection of data from sensors using wireless devices and transmitting to a remote server for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Knowledge-based data are stored. Rule-based procedures will be applied for the suggestions and treatment of diabetes, informing the patient about his current health condition, prediction, and recommendation of future changes in BG. First, essential data about patient health will be collected from sensors such as BLE wireless devices. Data comprised weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, and heartbeat, along with some demographic information such as age, sex, name, and CNIC (Social Security Number). Some information is required in the application installed on the user's mobile and sensor data. All completed data in the application will be transferred to the real-time data processing system. On the other side, aggregate data will be stored in MongoDB for future processing. Analysis and prepossessing techniques are performed to extract rules from the knowledge base for the treatment and suggestions about the user. Results and treatment procedures will be sent to the monitoring system, and finally, the user can get the output by interacting with their android mobile phone. In the end, the patient will know about the health condition and risk prediction of diabetes based on the data transferred by their application and stored data from history about the user."
36279639,Harnessing machine learning models for non-invasive pre-diabetes screening in children and adolescents,"Pre-diabetes has been identified as an intermediate diagnosis and a sign of a relatively high chance of developing diabetes in the future. Diabetes has become one of the most frequent chronic disorders in children and adolescents around the world; therefore, predicting the onset of pre-diabetes allows a person at risk to make efforts to avoid or restrict disease progression. This research aims to create and implement a cross-validated machine learning model that can predict pre-diabetes using non-invasive methods. We have analysed the national representative dataset of children and adolescents (5-19 years) to develop a machine learning model for non-invasive pre-diabetes screening. Based on HbA1c levels the data (n = 26,567) was segregated into normal (n = 23,777) and pre-diabetes (n = 2790). We have considered eight features, six hyper-tuned machine learning models and different metrics for model evaluation. The final model was selected based on the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), Cohen's kappa and cross-validation score. The selected model was integrated into the screening tool for automated pre-diabetes prediction. The XG boost classifier was the best model, including all eight features. The 10-fold cross-validation score was highest for the XG boost model (90.13%) and least for the support vector machine (61.17%). The AUC was highest for RF (0.970), followed by GB (0.968), XGB (0.959), ETC (0.918), DT (0.908), and SVM (0.574) models. The XGB model was used to develop the screening tool. We have developed and deployed a machine learning model for automated real-time pre-diabetes screening. The screening tool can be used over computers and can be transformed into software for easy usage. The detection of pre-diabetes in the pediatric age may help avoid its enhancement. Machine learning can also show great competence in determining important features in pre-diabetes.","Diabetes is a major lifestyle disease requiring a population-based screening and treatment approach. The present study proposed a machine learning model for pre-diabetes screening for children and adolescents (5Ð19 years) in India. We have used a novel method for predicting pre-diabetes which can be applied in community settings. Initial screening for pre-diabetes without consideration of any biomarkers with 90.13% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy (XGB model) implies public health benefits. It can prevent the development of diabetes on a large scale. India is the second most populated country, with 9.2% of children and 9.5% of adolescents suffering from pre-diabetes [19]; therefore, it might not be economically feasible to set up labs for non-invasive screening in communities. But existing PHCs (public health centres) & AWCs (anganwadi centres) can be trained for somatometric measurements for occasional pre-diabetes screening through a non-invasive ML tool. Diabetes is a multifactorial disorder, but determining the top contributing features may assist us in focusing initially on important features. TSFT, MUAC, WC, age and height were the top five features determining the model accuracy in our four models. A study among children (8 years) in India has calculated the sum of skinfolds to represent the combined result of different skinfold thickness measurements, showing an evolving risk of diabetes with greater skinfold measurements [27]. Further, a study among type 1 diabetes children in India reported inconsistent growth patterns [28]. The prevalence of diabetes increases among adolescents and young adults (21), depending on various lifestyle changes with age [29]. In the diabetes prediction studies using AI, ML and DL techniques, the deployment and external validation of the dataset were missing in most of the studies [30,31]. Although, a study developed a smart web application based on the SVM model [32]. We also deployed the best model through the web portal to provide an applicative benefit in real-time screening. Predicting pre-diabetes in early life stages can be an insightful approach for diabetes prevention and lifestyle modification. In the last decade, AI has shown promising results in transforming the healthcare sector. Various aspects of diabetes can be predicted using AI & ML models [33]. Real-time screening tools for diabetes complications and data mining from repositories can facilitate the early detection of disease and smoothen the treatments. An approach for pre-diabetes screening using the support vector machine has achieved an accuracy of 64.9% on internal validation and 66.1% on external validation [34]. Another study based on the k-means clustering algorithm has classified diabetes, pre-diabetes and controls [35]. A study conducted in rural India (n = 5655) based on nutritional intake and demographic cohort dataset for pre-diabetes prediction implemented the generalised linear mixed model and achieved the AUC of 72% with eight features [36]. Our study achieved the comparatively highest model evaluation score due to the consideration of associated risk factors such as features, large data size and hyperparameter tuning of ML models. However, due to the lack of studies classifying pre-diabetes using AI & ML methods, it becomes difficult to assess the feasibility of AI & ML in pre-diabetes prediction worldwide. The complication of diabetes has been studied widely, using multiple ML algorithms [30] based on cohort or follow-up data sets, which were analysed in the context of diabetes prediction in the near future. Several ML modellings were done over Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) to classify diabetes. The PIDD consists of eight features, and ML models have shown reliable accuracy in classifying outcomes [37,38]. The highest accuracy using PIDD was 98% achieved using deep learning architecture [39]. Our study has obtained the highest AUC with the XGB model. In another study, the XGB model-based study has shown 80.2% accuracy in diabetes prediction [40]. A modelling study combining different features has reported the highest AUC of 0.86 for the GB model using non-invasive parameters [41]. A comparative study of four ML models on a diabetes dataset (n = 13,309), including biomarkers, has shown GB model AUC (83.9%) was slightly higher than the RF model (83%). Random forest modelling on a Chinese dataset with 11 non-biomarker features obtained 71% accuracy [42]. In another study, the RF classifier, combined with SVM-SMOTE and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature reduction approach, produced the highest accuracy in classifying people at high risk of diabetes from healthy controls [43]. The least accuracy and AUC in the present study were obtained with the SVM model (57.33%). The support vector machine algorithm aims to determine the optimal highest-margin separation hyperplane between two classes given a two-class training sample [44]. Studies based on the support vector machine algorithm (SVM) have obtained 99.2% and 65.6% in Columbian and other patients, respectively [45]. Another SVM study mentioning diagnosed diabetes vs pre-diabetes or no diabetes showed an AUC of 83.5% [46]. A study also used a heart rate variability signal from ECG to predict diabetes via classifying diabetes and normal signals using deep learning and SVM as classification algorithms [47]. However, the evaluation metrics of different ML models may vary according to the datasets, feature selection techniques, software/programming language used and parameters applied during the model training. The hyperparameter tuning should be considered during model training because it may significantly impact model performance [48]. The present study provides a novel idea for pre-diabetes screening which can be implemented in any part of the world with an algorithm developed from a representable dataset. Further, we have performed all the necessary steps required to reduce the biasness in the dataset. The key strength of our work was the data pre-processing and automated feature selection based on hyperparameter tuning for achieving the best classification accuracy and model deployment for real-time applications. The limitation of the present work includes data balancing (augmentation), which was representative data but not raw data. Data augmentation was done to remove the representation biasness from both the groups (normal and pre-diabetes). We have also not performed any external validation of the model, which may differ from the given cross-validation accuracy. However, considering this as a prototype, we can increase the number of non-invasive features based on external validation results."
35255295,COVID-19 mortality risk assessments for individuals with and without diabetes mellitus: Machine learning models integrated with interpretation framework,"This research develops machine learning models equipped with interpretation modules for mortality risk prediction and stratification in cohorts of hospitalised coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). To this end, routinely collected clinical data from 156 COVID-19 patients with DM and 349 COVID-19 patients without DM were scrutinised. First, a random forest classifier forecasted in-hospital COVID-19 fatality utilising admission data for each cohort. For the DM cohort, the model predicted mortality risk with the accuracy of 82%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 80%, sensitivity of 80%, and specificity of 56%. For the non-DM cohort, the achieved accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 80%, 84%, 91%, and 56%, respectively. The models were then interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which explained predictors' global and local influences on model outputs. Finally, the k-means algorithm was applied to cluster patients on their SHAP values. The algorithm demarcated patients into three clusters. Average mortality rates within the generated clusters were 8%, 20%, and 76% for the DM cohort, 2.7%, 28%, and 41.9% for the non-DM cohort, providing a functional method of risk stratification.","In general, clinical studies have demonstrated an association between most selected features in this research (presented in subsection 3.1) and COVID-19 complications [35]. More specifically, smoking status, asthma, and HF were among features selected for the DM cohort, underlining the established increased risk of these preexisting factors for COVID-19 patients with DM [36]. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the selection of NLRL and APTTL for the DM cohort was consistent with findings of previous work [9]. Such congruence with the literature implies the effectiveness of the feature selection analysis in laying a reliable foundation for the ensuing ML-based mortality risk assessments. The evaluation results of the mortality risk prediction models (presented in subsection 3.2) emphasise the overall effectiveness of the analysis in predicting mortality risk for both cohorts. Moreover, the modelsÕ performance was comparable, enabling fair intercohort analogies. This comparable performance may imply that the oversampling process has effectively addressed the concerns regarding data group imbalances. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, overall, contributions of high NLRLs to increased mortality risk predictions were more than contributions of low NLRLs to decreased mortality risk predictions in the DM cohort. Conversely, low frailty scores contributed more to lower mortality risk predictions than high frailty scores did for higher mortality risk predictions. Similarly, among other high-impact variables for the DM cohort, Na, WCC, smoking status, and neutrophils contributed more to increased mortality risk predictions overall, whereas age, APTTL and CRP contributed more to decreased mortality risk predictions. Likewise, it can be implied from Fig. 2B that creatine had a greater adverse than protective impact in the DM cohort, while age and procalcitonin had a greater protective than adverse impact overall. However, the differences between the protective and adverse contributions were inconclusive for other high-impact predictors of the non-DM cohort. Such analysis could help compare protective versus adverse impact of features. For instance, since high NLRL showed a stronger adverse impact compared to the protective impact from low NLRL in the DM cohort, it could be inferred that this feature was overall a stronger adverse risk factor rather than a protective factor in this cohort. Of note, older ages were associated with increased mortality risk predictions in both cohorts (positive SHAP values in Fig. 2), but this effect was more marked in the DM cohort. One possible explanation could be that the chance of having co-existing features that increased mortality predictions occurred more often in older DM cases than non-DM cases. Overall, local interpretation results (presented in subsection 3.4) show how explaining the model's output for an individual can differ from explaining the model's output globally across the cohort. This evidence stresses the advantages of individualised risk explanations over generic risk descriptions. The SHAP clustering outcomes (presented in subsection 3.5) are in line with real-world risk stratification requirements, namely for applications in triage systems, where the aim is to allocate patients into predefined categories with different risk grades [37]. This evidence supports the potential capability of SHAP clustering in practical COVID-19 mortality risk stratification. Table 7 summarises some statistical characteristics of features within the three formed clusters for each cohort to explore patterns apart from the frequency and mortality rate presented in Table 6. For conciseness, only the three most predictive variables, according to Fig. 1, are investigated for each cohort. Based on the table, one noteworthy intercluster pattern for the DM cohort was that all patients in Cluster 3 had a high NLRL. Another marked pattern was that patients in Cluster 1 had a considerably lower average frailty score than patients in Clusters 2 and 3. On the other hand, for the non-DM cohort, a significant pattern was that the average albumin for patients in Cluster 3 was considerably higher than that in Clusters 2 and 1. Also, the average age in Cluster 1 was considerably lower than that in Clusters 2 and 3. Finally, there was a decrease in the average eGFR from Clusters 1 towards 3."
35875747,Prediction of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus under Cascade and Ensemble Learning Algorithm,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the risk factors for fetal dysplasia and maternal pregnancy difficulties. Therefore, the prediction of the risk of GDM in advance has become a big demand for millions of families. Therefore, machine learning technology is adopted to study GDM prediction. Firstly, the data is preprocessed, and the mean value is used for outlier processing. After preprocessing of the data, the IV value method is used to screen the features. Of the 83 features in the original sample data, 40 important features are screened out through feature engineering. On this basis, Logistics regression model, Lasso-Logistics, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Lightgbm), and Gradient Boosting Categorical Features (Catboost) are established, and multiple learners are integrated. Finally, the constructed model is tested on data sets. The accuracy of the proposed model is 80.3%, the accuracy is 74.6%, the recall rate is 79.3%, and the running time is only 2.53 seconds. This means that the proposed model is superior to the previous models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1 value, and the time consumption is also in line with the actual engineering requirements. The proposed scheme provides some ideas for the research of machine learning technology in disease prediction.","Under the same conditions, the XGBoost model, the LightGBM model, and the Catboost model are utilized as models 1, 2, and 3 for the experiment, respectively. The experimental results are shown in Table 4. After cascading, the F1 value of XGBoost model, LightGBM model, and Catboost model are all improved in contrast to the previous single model. When the Catboost model is utilized as the model 1, the F1 value of the cascade model is increased to 0.763 from 0.721 of single model, with an increase of 4.2%. When the LightGBM model is utilized as the model 1 and the Catboost model is utilized as the model 2, the F1 value of the cascade model is increased to 0.701 from 0.664 of single model, with an increase of 4.2%. When the XGBoost model is utilized as model 1 and the Catboost model is utilized as model 2, the F1 value of the cascaded model increases less. When the three sub-models are all Catboost models, the cascade model works best. The model proposed in this work is compared with the model proposed by Jianyu Yu et al. On the same data set, the F1 value of the model proposed by Jianyu Yu et al. is 0.726, and the F1 value of model proposed in this work is 0.793, with an increase of 6.7%. The proposed model is compared with the Catboost single model on the same data set, and results show that the cascaded model has a significant increase in test time versus single model. However, when it comes to precision, accuracy, recall rate, and F1, the cascaded model is superior to Catboost single model, as shown in Table 5."
32869093,Predicting complications of diabetes mellitus using advanced machine learning algorithms,"We sought to predict if patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) would develop 10 selected complications. Accurate prediction of complications could help with more targeted measures that would prevent or slow down their development. Experiments were conducted on the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases of California for the period of 2003 to 2011. Recurrent neural network (RNN) long short-term memory (LSTM) and RNN gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning methods were designed and compared with random forest and multilayer perceptron traditional models. Prediction accuracy of selected complications were compared on 3 settings corresponding to minimum number of hospitalizations between diabetes diagnosis and the diagnosis of complications. The diagnosis domain was used for experiments. The best results were achieved with RNN GRU model, followed by RNN LSTM model. The prediction accuracy achieved with RNN GRU model was between 73% (myocardial infarction) and 83% (chronic ischemic heart disease), while accuracy of traditional models was between 66% - 76%. The number of hospitalizations was an important factor for the prediction accuracy. Experiments with 4 hospitalizations achieved significantly better accuracy than with 2 hospitalizations. To achieve improved accuracy deep learning models required training on at least 1000 patients and accuracy significantly dropped if training datasets contained 500 patients. The prediction accuracy of complications decreases over time period. Considering individual complications, the best accuracy was achieved on depressive disorder and chronic ischemic heart disease. The RNN GRU model was the best choice for electronic medical record type of data, based on the achieved results.","In conducted experiments both deep learning algorithms were significantly more accurate than traditional models. Sarwar and colleagues reported accuracies for prediction of diabetes for the following ML models: logistic regression 74% accuracy, SVM 77%, nave Bayes, decision tree 74%, RF 71% and K nearest neighbors achieved 77%.24 Ngufor et al33 applied tree-based ML algorithms such as RF, gradient-boosted machine, recursive partitioning, conditional inference trees, and a mixed-effect ML (MEml) framework to predict longitudinal change in hemoglobin A1c. Ngufor et alÕs model assumes that the number of variables which change over the time period is small. In the case of hemoglobin A1c application, there is only 1 continuous variable that changes longitudinally. However, in our experiments, diagnoses are categorical variables (with more than 1000 categories) which change with each visit, making Ngufor et alÕs method inapplicable. In the last time, according to numerous publications, RNN-based models proved to be superior to traditional models with high-dimensional temporal EMR type of data. Choi et al34 showed that RNN deep learning models performed better than traditional ML approaches on EMR temporal data. Massaro et al21 described an application of a deep learning LSTM model as a very good choice for diabetes prediction. Zhang et al25 applied the MetaPred model and transfer learning using convolutional neural networks and LSTM RNN models in addition to traditional ML models. Our study focuses on detection of the most often complications of DM2, using high-dimensional EMR type of data. RNN models, especially GRU, achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy (Table 2) by discovering complex temporal relationships inside EMR data. A t test (P = .05 level) did not show a statistically significant difference between the 2 RNN models. Comparison of 2 traditional ML models shows that both models performed similarly. Our experiments show that an RNN GRU model is the best choice for the high dimensional temporal EMR data. It performed significantly better than traditional models, according to a t test at the level of P = .05. Considering the number of hospitalizations filter deep learning models achieved the best results when data include 4 hospitalizations after DM2 diagnosis vs relaying on less hospitalizations. The accuracy of our RNN GRU model with 4 hospitalizations achieved values between 73.3% (MI) and 83.5% (ICHD). Datasets with 2 hospitalizations are 2-3 times larger than datasets with 4 hospitalizations. Our results point toward the number of hospitalizations as more important factor for prediction results than the size of datasets. We did not find significant difference in prediction accuracy if the minimum number of hospitalizations was 3 instead of 4. Analyzes of the influence of sizes of datasets indicate that about 1000 patients are sufficient in the positive dataset for RNN models. The performance of RNN ML models decreased significantly when the size of datasets decreased to 500 patients. Traditional ML models did not show statistically significant changes in achieved accuracy if the size of datasets decreased to 500. They also did not show significant changes in accuracy with changes in the number of hospitalizations. Figure 3 shows that prediction accuracy of DR decreases over time. In case of 2 hospitalizations, the accuracy decreases steadily over time because the sizes of datasets are big enough not to affect performance of deep learning models. In experiments with 4 hospitalizations the initial accuracy within 1 year is lower because that dataset was relatively small (523 patients), which is less than the optimal number of patients for the performance of the GRU model. After this initial period, the rest of the curve in Figure 3B is similar to the curve in Figure 3A. Similar changes are noticed with all other complications. Considering individual complications, RNN models were the most accurate when predicting depressive disorder and ICHD. These 2 diseases had the largest absolute numbers of patients in positive cohorts. The prediction accuracy of ICHD was 83.5%, which was significantly better than the prediction accuracy of hearing loss (the smallest dataset) or MI which were 73.4% and 73.3% consequently. Individual diseases performed differently, and it is difficult to determine whether the size of datasets, comorbidities of individual complications, or perhaps time gaps between different visits influenced prediction results. Analyses of probabilities of development of 10 complications show that ICHD, depressive disorder, and diabetic neuropathy have higher probability of occurrence (13%-14%) than all other complications, including hearing loss with the probability of occurrence of only 2%. Results of our research with early and accurate prediction of 10 frequent complications of DM2 are important for targeting high-risk patients for monitoring and intervention. They would enable application of timely prevention measures, which will postpone complications, improve quality of life, and increase survival rates. Our methodology could be generally applied to prediction accuracy problems of any other disease or complications of that disease. It could be applied to predict cancer diseases, from EMR type of data, or it can be applied to predict chronic diseases, such as heart or lung diseases or complications of those chronic diseases. It can also be applied to predict acute medical conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, acute kidney failure, or occurrence of infectious diseases (eg, flu, coronavirus, hepatitis). Further improvement of created RNN models would improve prediction accuracy of DM2 complications and other diseases, which could have significant clinical implications. It could become incorporated into a clinical decision support system and help clinical workers to improve quality of health care. Our GRU RNN model can predict a clinical event (disease, complication) with high accuracy. By demonstrating that application of RNN deep learning models can make successful prediction of clinical events we hope that our study may contribute to facilitate a wider use of ML in clinical medicine in the form of a clinical decision support system. Also, it could be applied in healthcare emergencies such as the current crisis with COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019) to make some important and helpful predictions that will help to public health experts."
37047748,Machine Learning as a Support for the Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. Among the main types of diabetes, type 2 is the most common. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent or delay the onset of complications. Previous studies examined the application of machine learning techniques for prediction of the pathology, and here an artificial neural network shows very promising results as a possible valuable aid in the management and prevention of diabetes. Additionally, its superior ability for long-term predictions makes it an ideal choice for this field of study. We utilized machine learning methods to uncover previously undiscovered associations between an individual's health status and the development of type 2 diabetes, with the goal of accurately predicting its onset or determining the individual's risk level. Our study employed a binary classifier, trained on scratch, to identify potential nonlinear relationships between the onset of type 2 diabetes and a set of parameters obtained from patient measurements. Three datasets were utilized, i.e., the National Center for Health Statistics' (NHANES) biennial survey, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV. These datasets were then combined to create a single dataset with the same number of individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. Since the dataset was balanced, the primary evaluation metric for the model was accuracy. The outcomes of this study were encouraging, with the model achieving accuracy levels of up to 86% and a ROC AUC value of 0.934. Further investigation is needed to improve the reliability of the model by considering multiple measurements from the same patient over time.","The research demonstrates the potential of binary classifiers trained from scratch to generalize the onset of diabetes in nonlinear relationships with specific patient measurements. The ablation study revealed that an ensemble of binary classifiers with a shallow architecture optimized using the Adam algorithm attained a satisfactory level of accuracy (approximately 86% on the test set) and an ROC AUC value of 0.934. This neural network-based approach may provide accurate information for personalized medicine, making it a valuable resource for decision making. Further studies incorporating multiple information of the same patient over time could lead to the development of an advanced model for disease prevention. This would be possible by identifying patterns, such as context patterns in the trends of the measurements, using advanced neural networks such as Long-Short-Term-Memory models."
35890983,Data-Driven Machine-Learning Methods for Diabetes Risk Prediction,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition characterized by a disturbance in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The most characteristic disorder in all forms of diabetes is hyperglycemia, i.e., elevated blood sugar levels. The modern way of life has significantly increased the incidence of diabetes. Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is a necessity. Machine Learning (ML) has gained great popularity among healthcare providers and physicians due to its high potential in developing efficient tools for risk prediction, prognosis, treatment and the management of various conditions. In this study, a supervised learning methodology is described that aims to create risk prediction tools with high efficiency for type 2 diabetes occurrence. A features analysis is conducted to evaluate their importance and explore their association with diabetes. These features are the most common symptoms that often develop slowly with diabetes, and they are utilized to train and test several ML models. Various ML models are evaluated in terms of the Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Accuracy and AUC metrics and compared under 10-fold cross-validation and data splitting. Both validation methods highlighted Random Forest and K-NN as the best performing models in comparison to the other models.","Finally, we note a limitation of this research work. This study was based on a publicly available dataset. The dataset we relied on does not come from a hospital unit or institute, which could give us richer information data models with different characteristics, such as biochemical measurements that record a detailed health profile of the participants. Acquiring access to such data is time-consuming and difficult for privacy reasons. The habits and lifestyle of the modern world are the results of the growing incidence of diabetes. Medical professionals now have the opportunity, with the contribution of machine-learning techniques, to assess the relative risk and provide appropriate guidelines and interventions for the management and treatment or prevention of diabetes. In this research article, we applied several machine-learning models in order to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on specific risk factors. Data exploration through risk factor analysis could help to identify associations between the features and diabetes. Performance analysis showed that data pre-processing is a major step in the design of efficient and accurate models for diabetes occurrence. Specifically, after applying SMOTE with 10-fold cross-validation, the Random Forest and KNN outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 98.59%. Similarly, applying SMOTE with a percentage split (80:20), the Random Forest and KNN outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 99.22%. In both cases, applying SMOTE, our proposed models were superior to the related published research works based on the [36] dataset with the same features we relied on in terms of accuracy. In future work, we aim to extend the machine-learning framework through the use of deep-learning methods by applying a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) algorithm and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the same dataset and comparing the results in terms of accuracy with relevant published works."
31413285,Artificial intelligence predicts the progression of diabetic kidney disease using big data machine learning,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to support clinical judgement in medicine. We constructed a new predictive model for diabetic kidney diseases (DKD) using AI, processing natural language and longitudinal data with big data machine learning, based on the electronic medical records (EMR) of 64,059 diabetes patients. AI extracted raw features from the previous 6 months as the reference period and selected 24 factors to find time series patterns relating to 6-month DKD aggravation, using a convolutional autoencoder. AI constructed the predictive model with 3,073 features, including time series data using logistic regression analysis. AI could predict DKD aggravation with 71% accuracy. Furthermore, the group with DKD aggravation had a significantly higher incidence of hemodialysis than the non-aggravation group, over 10 years (N = 2,900). The new predictive model by AI could detect progression of DKD and may contribute to more effective and accurate intervention to reduce hemodialysis.","In this study, we showed that AI could predict the progression of DKD using big data machine learning, according to the EMR of T2DM patients. Our study used three novel approaches to improve the predictive capacity of disease-specific complications. First, we constructed a new predictive model of diabetic complications before the patients showed clinical signs or symptoms such as microalbuminuria. Second, we used big EMR data for machine-learning by AI without any objective of clinical research; we included cases not defined clinically as T2DM in their text on EMR. Third, AI used time-series data from 6 months before the reference periods and predicted the progression of DKD for 6 months after the reference periods. DKD is one of the most common diabetic complications and its progression results in hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD)3,22. DKD is the major cause of hemodialysis in many countries3. Diabetes patients with normoalbuminuria have been reported to progress to microalbuminuria at 2.8%/year23,24. Because microalbuminuria is considered to be an early marker predicting diabetic nephropathy and subsequent ESRD, remission of microalbuminuria should mean less ESRD in the future25,26. There are several reports concerning the remission of early stage DKD, such as diabetic nephropathy at stage 2, where patients have 30Ð300_mg urinary microalbumin/day6Ð9. Theoretically, the earlier the intervention for DKD, the better the outcome we can expect in terms of remission. However, early intervention in stage 1 DKD must be less cost-effective and has the risk of overdiagnosis and/or overtreatment. Other biomarkers in diabetes patients with normoalbuminuria, such as urinary L-type fatty acid binding protein and serum tumor necrosis factor-_ and its receptors, could also be surrogate markers of diabetic nephropathy27, but none of these markers is perfect. Liao et al. recently reported that urinary proteomics analysis could be useful to detect early diabetic nephropathy and that the haptoglobin-to-creatinine ratio might provide a better predictive value for early renal functional decline in 4.2 years than the microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio28. In this study, we constructed a model of early stage DKD at stage 1 to 2 diabetic nephropathy. With this approach, we could define T2DM at an early stage of DKD but with a higher future risk of its progress. It may be beneficial to provide more intensive care, such as statins and anti-hypertensive medicine, for these patients. Proteinuria is related to atherosclerosis, resulting in cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease and apoplexy29. For diabetes patients, we used microalbuminuria as a surrogate marker to predict ESRD and other atherogenic cardiovascular events30. We showed here that progression of DKD in 6 months could result in a higher incidence of hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure in our patients over 10 years. Furthermore, the unstable proteinuria group had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events than the stable non-proteinuria group. These results suggest that very early intervention to reduce proteinuria could contribute to a better prognosis for both renal and cardiac diseases. Many countries have progressed to super-aging societies and elderly patients are liable to have several diseases at the same time. Therefore, clinical medicine in super-aging societies is more complicated and clinical trials to find effective treatments are more difficult. In previous works to predict diabetes complications, they calculated the risks with several clinical information such as current age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, presence or absence of microalbuminuria or worse, and laboratory data for diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia31. With this approach, we could pick up known risk factors according to the previous report but could not include unknown risk factors. In addition, when we perform the clinical trials to prove the efficacy of the treatment, we need to register many untreated patients as control. In our approach to find an AI-supported predictive model for chronic diseases such as T2DM, we can elucidate the combination of clinical risk factors with less expense and less effort than current clinical trials. AI has the advantages of improving clinical medicine in the field with digital data such as imaging11,12, pharmacokinetics13, genetics14 and oncology15. Recent studies with AI in the field of diabetes represent a diverse and complex set of innovative approaches that aim to transform diabetes care in four main areas: automated retinal screening, clinical decision support, predictive population risk stratification, and patient self-management tools32. AI could improve imaging techniques such as diabetic retinopathy screening33, because digital imaging is an aggregation of many pixels with the same processing condition. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted the marketing of the first medical device to use AI to detect diabetic retinopathy. There are several innovative studies using a machine-learning approach to develop phenotyping frameworks to detect diabetes16, the progression of diabetes18 and hypoglycemia17. However, an AI-oriented predictive model of diabetic complications has not yet been developed. Our current study suggests that AI could support our decision to reduce future clinical events at an early stage of complications in chronic diseases such as T2DM. There are some limitations to this study. First, the information obtained from each EMR, especially from the medical doctorsÕ records, varies considerably and we could not unify the data extraction from each patient. Second, the duration between each laboratory test was not uniform and depended on the individual patient. Third, this study was carried out in a single center and has not been reevaluated using EMR from other institutions. Fourth, we could not find any relationship between progression of DKD for 6 months and medication. Because the patients without DKD are likely to be treated less intensively, we suggest that the medication itself may not have affected the progression of DKD in this study. Therefore, we still need prospective study to prove very early intervention to DKD could prevent macrovascular events including ESRD and CVD in T2DM patients. In conclusion, the new predictive model using AI could detect the progression of DKD, which may contribute to more effective and accurate intervention to reduce hemodialysis and cardiovascular events."
36429751,Machine Learning Models for Data-Driven Prediction of Diabetes by Lifestyle Type,"The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing in recent years, and previous research has found that machine-learning models are good diabetes prediction tools. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of five different machine-learning models for diabetes prediction using lifestyle data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. The 1999-2020 NHANES database yielded data on 17,833 individuals data based on demographic characteristics and lifestyle-related variables. To screen training data for machine models, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) forward propagation algorithm was utilized. For predicting diabetes, five machine-learning models (CATBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) were developed. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Among the five machine-learning models, the dietary intake levels of energy, carbohydrate, and fat, contributed the most to the prediction of diabetes patients. In terms of model performance, CATBoost ranks higher than RF, LG, XGBoost, and SVM. The best-performing machine-learning model among the five is CATBoost, which achieves an accuracy of 82.1% and an AUC of 0.83. Machine-learning models based on NHANES data can assist medical institutions in identifying diabetes patients.","Using five machine-learning models (CATBoost, XGBoost, RF, LR, and SVM), we attempted to predict diabetes based on lifestyle-related variables. We preprocessed the input data before training the model and used the mean to impute data with <5% missing values. In addition, we used SMOTE-NC to class-balance the data (the number of negative samples was much larger than the number of positive samples) to prevent the machine-learning model from outputting a single negative conclusion when making predictions when our dataset is class-imbalanced. Ultimately, we found that the performance ranking of the five machine-learning models was CATBoost > RF > LR > XGBoost > SVM. CATBoost has the best performance indicators among the five machine-learning models, with an AUC of 0.83 and an accuracy rate of 82.1%. Therefore, CATBoost may be employed as the best model for diabetes prediction for individuals in the prediction of machine-learning models based on or even modality variables. Previous studies have attempted to build machine-learning models for predicting diabetes. However, most previous studies employed random forests, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and other machine learning models based on bagging algorithms to predict diabetes [45,46,47,48]. For example, Hu et al. [47] built a diabetes prediction model for adolescents using logistic regression and Gradient Boosted Tree and finally obtained a machine-learning model with an RUC of 71%. Krishnamoorthi [49] et al. An intelligent framework for diabetes prediction was constructed by applying four machine learning methods, with an RUC of 0.8 and final prediction accuracy of 83%. Although previous researchers have achieved good model results, few machine learning models for diabetes prediction based on the Boosting algorithm are still few. For example, Kumar et al. used CatBoost, logistic regression, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks to predict the probability of diabetes in gestational women and finally got an AUC of 0.86. Zhang et al. used logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and Catboost and Xgboost to predict childhood insulin resistance and obtained an AUC of 0.85. Using the Boosting algorithm to develop a model can better solve the problem of gradient bias and prediction offset, thereby reducing the occurrence of overfitting and improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the algorithm [45,46,47,48]. Compared with previous studies, our study optimized the previous researchersÕ diabetes prediction model, which achieved higher AUC and accuracy rates on easy access to characteristic variables. As characteristic factors in our study, we selected demographics data and 18 lifestyle data from NHANES. Gender, age, race, country of birth, education level, poverty ratio, BMI, energy, protein, carbohydrates, sugar, total fat, cholesterol, smoking status, sleep duration, alcohol consumption, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were among them. Most previous researchers [50,51,52] included biochemical indicators as an essential variable in their diabetes-prediction models. Lifestyle-related indicators have better collectability and de-aggression than biomarkers. Therefore, the model we established is independent of biochemical indicators, and our goal is to construct a practical and user-friendly screening model. Figure 2 depicts the relative importance of various variables, which is consistent with past reports [53], with sleep duration, daily nutrient intake (such as energy, carbohydrates, fat, etc.), and age being the most important variables influencing model design. Furthermore, according to CiveiraÕs research [54], age ranks third in feature importance as an essential demographic variable. In the diabetes domain, diabetes datasets are often class-imbalanced datasets (a large number of people without diabetes and a small number of people with diabetes). Therefore, in contrast to earlier studies [46], we employed the SMOTE-NC method to deal with imbalanced class data. In contrast to prior research that did not use class imbalanced data, our machine-learning model could reduce missing and misdiagnosis rates. In addition, having too many variables in the model makes it heavy and slow. The significant increase in the data dimension will in-crease the complexity of the classification model, as well as the phenomenon of overfitting [32]. Feature selection plays an important role in traditional [55,56] and deep machine learning [57]. Thus we utilized the quantifiable AIC forward [33] propagation metric to filter the variables and eliminate the variables that contributed the least to the model. In the future, our research will be more inclined to the field of deep learning, combining big data samples with deep learning models. In addition, we will further increase the sample size and strive to optimize the model further to have better model prediction performance."
35773925,Customized and Automated Machine Learning-Based Models for Diabetes Type 2 Classification,"This study aims to develop models to accurately classify patients with type 2 diabetes using the Practice Fusion dataset. We use Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), AdaBoost classifier, an ensemble model, and automated machine learning (AutoML) model. We compare the performance of all models in a five-fold cross-validation scheme using four evaluation measures. Experimental results demonstrate that the AutoML model outperformed individual and ensemble models in all evaluation measures.","To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation and calculated the average of the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score for each model. Table 1 shows the average scores of the 5-fold cross-validation of the top-performing model on the AutoML leaderboard, the customized ensemble classifier, and the individual classifiers. By comparing the efficiency of the AutoML model with the customized models, as shown by the results in Table 1, the AutoML model demonstrates superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 90%, 95.9 %, 83%, 89%, respectively. It is clear that the ensemble classifier has achieved maximum accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall of 82.9%, 73.5%, 91.1%, and 75.85, respectively. These results show that an ensemble classifier provides better overall results compared to the individual models since the ensemble combines the predictions of various models. By comparing the results of the individual classifiers, SVC is superior in terms of accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, with scores of 81.8%, 71.9%, 89.1%, and 75.7%, respectively. Among all the models, the AutoML model achieved the best performance, exceeding the performance of other customized models. This finding indicates that AutoML tools perform reasonably well on diabetes binary classification tasks. Despite the ability of AutoML tools to limit the burden on data scientists, it cannot eliminate the need for trained data engineers to make accurate predictions."
35808300,Machine Learning-Based Risk Stratification for Gestational Diabetes Management,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is often diagnosed during the last trimester of pregnancy, leaving only a short timeframe for intervention. However, appropriate assessment, management, and treatment have been shown to reduce the complications of GDM. This study introduces a machine learning-based stratification system for identifying patients at risk of exhibiting high blood glucose levels, based on daily blood glucose measurements and electronic health record (EHR) data from GDM patients. We internally trained and validated our model on a cohort of 1148 pregnancies at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH), and performed external validation on 709 patients from Royal Berkshire Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (RBH). We trained linear and non-linear tree-based regression models to predict the proportion of high-readings (readings above the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guideline) a patient may exhibit in upcoming days, and found that XGBoost achieved the highest performance during internal validation (0.021 [CI 0.019-0.023], 0.482 [0.442-0.516], and 0.112 [0.109-0.116], for MSE, R2, MAE, respectively). The model also performed similarly during external validation, suggesting that our method is generalizable across different cohorts of GDM patients.","In this study, we developed a data-driven machine learning model to identify patients at risk of exhibiting high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia). This is a crucial task, as there is an appreciation that there exists a spectrum of diseases and outcomes, and assigning all women to the same care pathway is not patient-centred and does not necessarily provide the best care for each woman. Furthermore, with an increasing prevalence of GDM and limited healthcare resources, it is important for healthcare providers to tailor care delivery to women who need itÑproviding a proportionate response to care delivery depending on glycaemic control and other risk factors. This study demonstrates the first machine learning-based stratification system for quantifying hyperglycaemia risk in GDM clinics, and is not limited to the existing GDm-Health platform. The model presented can be used by any GDM clinic if they have access to patientsÕ daily blood glucose data, and such a tool could be used to identify patients who require more urgent clinical review or need an adjustment to their current treatment. In order to translate this tool into clinical practice, future studies can consider converting the model results into a risk score (e.g., thresholding the regression scores into categories, combining regression scores with other clinical features to define the degree of risk). We found that tree-based ensemble models significantly outperformed a linear model. This may be due to their inherent ability to consider non-linear effects of the features. Additionally, tree-based models are less sensitive to extreme values (e.g., outliers, any data measurement errors which can occur from the data collection process) compared to linear regression. This is further demonstrated by MLR performing better on the filtered dataset, where extreme blood glucose values and sensor errors were removed prior to training (Table A8). Moreover, in particular, we found that XGBoost achieved the highest overall performance, thanks to the boosting technique it utilizes, where trees are sequentially added and fit to correct for the previous prediction errors made. There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, the MSE, R2, MAE, and rank accuracy scores suggest that this model can perform moderately accurately for predicting high blood glucose readings, especially those in the upper-bound group. However, the scores achieved require improvement in order to be suitable for clinical practice. This lower performance may be due to the small dataset size used in training, data imbalance, and possible clinical confounders that were not considered during model development. Further development needs to be conducted with clinical experts to both increase the sample size and determine what confounders should be included in the study. In terms of the algorithmic approach, a weighted regression model may help improve model fitting, especially when there is imbalanced data. Additionally, a times-series modelling approach (such as the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model) could be investigated, as it could provide more detailed insight into blood glucose patterns, improving monitoring capacity. As blood glucose measurements are self-measured, there is variation in the number and length of recordings completed by each patient. Thus, when splitting the data into windows, there was an unequal number of samples contributed from different patients. Ideally, the number of samples available from each patient is balanced; however, in the real world, this is difficult to achieve as women may be diagnosed at different points in their pregnancy and may have very different lifestyles, making it difficult to collect consistent measurements across all patients. If enough data is available, one possible solution can be regularizing the number of samples contributed by each patient (reducing the bias contributed by any individual patient). Similarly, future models can collectively consider multiple windows per patient rather than treating each window separately. The specification of when a patient started or stopped taking GDM-related medication was not clear in our data. We considered women who had taken any medication for blood glucose control (metformin or insulin) as the medication group and the remainder as the non-medication group. Patients who changed from non-medication to medication during the data collection period of the study, were considered as part of the medication group. This is a limitation of this study, as it may have impacted the modelsÕ ability to confidently differentiate different groups and accurately predict the high-reading percentages. By comparing model performance results (Table 5) and SHAP values (Figure A1, Figure A2, Figure A3, Figure A4, Figure A5, Figure A6, Figure A7 and Figure A8), we found that including the medication feature did not significantly change our results when compared to the baseline model. Thus, future analyses should be performed, with more data, to confirm the effectiveness of including this feature. Data missingness is another limitation, as we used real-world clinical data sets. After we removed samples with values missing values from any of our selected features, the size of data available for training and testing was reduced to 70% and 25% of the original dataset size in the OUH and RBH datasets, respectively. Thus, future analyses would greatly benefit from more data or the application of different data imputation methods. For this study, we did not have enough data to impute missing values in a way that would be biologically accurate. In general, overall performance did not differ significantly with the addition of non-blood-glucose features. This may be due to the size of our dataset, as a larger number of features often require a larger sample size for training. Additionally, it is difficult to understand how different behavioral, physiological, and genetic factors independently and collectively affect GDM, and thus, there may be other factors that are better suited to use in the model than the ones we tested. For example, known diabetes risk factors (e.g., high BMI, previously having a macrosomic baby, being from an ethnicity with a higher prevalence of GDM), may be important in blood glucose prediction. In this paper, whilst we were not able to test these features, this reflects the reality of features directly accessible by most GDM clinics. Although BMI was not included in our main model development (due to many missing values), it was ranked moderately high in terms of feature importance in our preliminary analyses (Table A7). Thus, future models can consider additional EHR features during development, as it may help improve model performance."
34299797,Predicting Type 2 Diabetes Using Logistic Regression and Machine Learning Approaches,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common human diseases worldwide and may cause several health-related complications. It is responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. A timely diagnosis and prediction of this disease could provide patients with an opportunity to take the appropriate preventive and treatment strategies. To improve the understanding of risk factors, we predict type 2 diabetes for Pima Indian women utilizing a logistic regression model and decision tree-a machine learning algorithm. Our analysis finds five main predictors of type 2 diabetes: glucose, pregnancy, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and age. We further explore a classification tree to complement and validate our analysis. The six-fold classification tree indicates glucose, BMI, and age are important factors, while the ten-node tree implies glucose, BMI, pregnancy, diabetes pedigree function, and age as the significant predictors. Our preferred specification yields a prediction accuracy of 78.26% and a cross-validation error rate of 21.74%. We argue that our model can be applied to make a reasonable prediction of type 2 diabetes, and could potentially be used to complement existing preventive measures to curb the incidence of diabetes and reduce associated costs.","Diabetes has become one of the leading causes of human death in recent decades. The incidence of diabetes has been continuously increasing every year due to several reasons including eating habits, sedentary lifestyle, and prevalence of unhealthful foods. Diabetes prediction model can contribute to the decision-making process in clinical management. Knowing the potential risk factors and identifying individuals at high risk in the early stages may aid in diabetes prevention. A host of prediction models for diabetes have been developed and applied, out of which logistic regression [21] and a machine learning algorithm-based classification tree [20] are among the most popular methods. Habibi et al. [6] suggest that a simple machine learning algorithm, a classification tree, could be used to screen diabetes without using a laboratory. However, the validity of these models for different locations, populations with different diets, lifestyle, races, and genetic makeup is still unknown. Additionally, only a limited number of the reliable predictive equation has been suggested for Pima Indian Women. Their prediction performance and validity vary considerably. To fill this gap in the literature, this study used logistic regression and a classification tree from the Pima Indian dataset to identify the important factors for type 2 diabetes. We selected variables based on the goodness of fit test and model selection criteria such as AIC, BIC, and MallowsÕ Cp. The decision trees were plotted, and the prediction accuracy and cross-validation error rate were calculated for the purpose of validation. Variables selected from the logistic regression and decision tree are very similar, suggesting that the variable identified helps predict diabetes and may be used as a decision tool. A higher BMI, reduced insulin secretion and action, a family history of diabetes, blood pressure, smoking status, and pregnancy status are considered common risk factors for type 2 diabetes [33,34]. Our study shows five main predictors for diabetes are frequency of pregnancies in women, glucose, pedigree, BMI, and age. These variables were also used in previous studies to predict diabetes. For example, Bays et al. [35] reported that increased BMI was associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. A study in Finland developed a diabetes risk score to predict diabetes and found that age, parental history of diabetes, BMI, high blood sugar level, and physical activities are among the predictors of diabetes [36]. People with higher glucose are more likely to develop diabetes. It may be because glucose is associated with insulin response [37]. Lyssenko et al. [33] reported that a family history of diabetes could double the risk of the disease. The pedigree provides a synthesis of the diabetes mellitus history in ancestors and the genetic relationship with the subject. It utilizes information from a personÕs family history to predict how likely a subject can get diabetes. A higher BMI results in obesity, which could increase the fat content of the pancreas and might affect the function of pancreatic cells. Obesity could also lead to insulin resistance [38,39]. Age is a risk factor for the onset of diabetes. Pancreatic cells lead to the decline of glucose sensitivity and impaired insulin secretion with aging [40]. The validation shows that our model has a relatively good predictive performance. The prediction accuracy of 78% from our preferred specification is close to previous studies on diabetes risk factors. For example, Lyssenko et al. [33] report accuracy rates of 74% to 77% for two different locations in the study of diabetes risk factors. Zou et al. [20] predict diabetes with accuracy values of 77% and 81% for the Pima Indian and Luzhou datasets, respectively. As indicated by Wilson et al. [41], we also found that complex models are not necessary to predict diseases; instead, logistic regression and classification tree techniques can be equally useful in predicting diabetes. However, validation of the proposed model among different groups of the population should be carried out. We acknowledge the limitations of our analysis. First, only a few predictors were considered to predict the risk of diabetes due to data limitations. Thus, our conclusion may not be generalizable to larger datasets with several predictors. Second, even the best predictive models and variable selection processes may yield different results according to location, type of dataset, and the algorithms used. Finally, we replaced missing values with medians of the respective variables which, although a common practice, could alter results. Future studies could incorporate several other risk factors such as genetic traits, gender, socio-economic status, physical activities, smoking, health information and attitude, food consumption, and spending to predicting diabetes in a more generalized population."
36433354,Interpretable Machine Learning for Inpatient COVID-19 Mortality Risk Assessments: Diabetes Mellitus Exclusive Interplay,"People with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at elevated risk of in-hospital mortality from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This vulnerability has spurred efforts to pinpoint distinctive characteristics of COVID-19 patients with DM. In this context, the present article develops ML models equipped with interpretation modules for inpatient mortality risk assessments of COVID-19 patients with DM. To this end, a cohort of 156 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with pre-existing DM is studied. For creating risk assessment platforms, this work explores a pool of historical, on-admission, and during-admission data that are DM-related or, according to preliminary investigations, are exclusively attributed to the COVID-19 susceptibility of DM patients. First, a set of careful pre-modelling steps are executed on the clinical data, including cleaning, pre-processing, subdivision, and feature elimination. Subsequently, standard machine learning (ML) modelling analysis is performed on the cured data. Initially, a classifier is tasked with forecasting COVID-19 fatality from selected features. The model undergoes thorough evaluation analysis. The results achieved substantiate the efficacy of the undertaken data curation and modelling steps. Afterwards, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique is assigned to interpret the generated mortality risk prediction model by rating the predictors' global and local influence on the model's outputs. These interpretations advance the comprehensibility of the analysis by explaining the formation of outcomes and, in this way, foster the adoption of the proposed methodologies. Next, a clustering algorithm demarcates patients into four separate groups based on their SHAP values, providing a practical risk stratification method. Finally, a re-evaluation analysis is performed to verify the robustness of the proposed framework.","Inpatient COVID-19 mortality risk assessment specifically designed for patients with pre-existing DM was performed in this work. This goal was achieved by investigating a set of clinical features exclusively pertaining to DM and COVID-19 interplay for 156 individuals. Initially, the clinical data of the studied subjects were carefully pre-treated for the subsequent standard ML modelling analysis. After that, a mortality risk prediction model was created, exercising established ML pipelines. Evaluation analysis was then performed on the generated model. The results underpinned the effectiveness of the data treatment and modelling analysis. Afterwards, the generated model was interpreted globally and locally using SHAP. These interpretations help extend the transparency of the analysis. Next, a mortality risk stratification system was developed upon the outcomes of the SHAP analysis. Finally, an extra analysis was performed to further examine the stability of the core pipelines, where the outcomes corroborated this. The analysis reported in this work can be applied to online surveillance of hospitalised patients. The findings suggest some critical features to be reviewed more carefully in this monitoring process. To further expand upon this area of knowledge, future work could include more rigorous scrutiny of SHAP clustering results by devising a nested model interpretation mechanism."
36231678,Early Prediction of Diabetes Using an Ensemble of Machine Learning Models,"Diabetes is one of the most rapidly spreading diseases in the world, resulting in an array of significant complications, including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, diabetic retinopathy, and neuropathy, among others, which contribute to an increase in morbidity and mortality rate. If diabetes is diagnosed at an early stage, its severity and underlying risk factors can be significantly reduced. However, there is a shortage of labeled data and the occurrence of outliers or data missingness in clinical datasets that are reliable and effective for diabetes prediction, making it a challenging endeavor. Therefore, we introduce a newly labeled diabetes dataset from a South Asian nation (Bangladesh). In addition, we suggest an automated classification pipeline that includes a weighted ensemble of machine learning (ML) classifiers: Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost (XGB), and LightGBM (LGB). Grid search hyperparameter optimization is employed to tune the critical hyperparameters of these ML models. Furthermore, missing value imputation, feature selection, and K-fold cross-validation are included in the framework design. A statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) test reveals that the performance of diabetes prediction significantly improves when the proposed weighted ensemble (DT + RF + XGB + LGB) is executed with the introduced preprocessing, with the highest accuracy of 0.735 and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.832. In conjunction with the suggested ensemble model, our statistical imputation and RF-based feature selection techniques produced the best results for early diabetes prediction. Moreover, the presented new dataset will contribute to developing and implementing robust ML models for diabetes prediction utilizing population-level data.","We provide new DDC datasets (see details in Section 2.1), which were used in all of the experiments described in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, utilizing the combined BHDS data of 2011 and 2017Ð18, there is no work that applied or proposed any ML techniques for early diabetes prediction. This is despite the fact that some studies are attempting to investigate the prevalence of diabetes in Bangladesh as well as the factors that influence the disease [71,72,73,74]. However, according to the findings of research that evaluated ML-based classifiers for automated detection and classification of diabetes in Bangladesh using BHDS 2011 data, the Bagged CART classifier exhibited the greatest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.600 [75]. On the other hand, we employed both BHDS 2011 and BHDS 2017 datasets and were successful in achieving an AUC of 0.832. Using data from the 2011 BDHS, Chowdhury et al. [71] discovered that the overall prevalence of diabetes was 11%, and that the frequency was somewhat lower in males (10.6%) than in women (11.2%). Respondents in the age group of 55Ð59 years with higher educational achievement and better social status had higher odds of having diabetes than those from a lower age group with no education and lower social status, respectively. They also found that socioeconomic level, location of residence, regions, overweight and obesity, as well as hypertension, were significant correlates with diabetes [71]. Since there are not enough studies that use the same DDC dataset for an accurate comparison, we are unable to compare our findings with those that have been published in a detailed tabular format. As an alternative, we have designed and implemented various variants of ML models and their ensembles. Although our predictive ensemble-based model (DT + RF + XGB + LGB) proclaims low accuracy of 73.5%, the results of our article provide a real provocation for the relevant research community to further improve the accuracy rate by using our suggested DDC dataset. However, it offers an acceptable AUC of 83.2%, which is one of the most robust metrics calculated from the ROC curve. The ROC curve represents the true positive rate versus the false positive rate. Therefore, it is evident that the outcomes moderately handle type I and type II errors. One of the constraints of this study is that our algorithm has been applied to only 7529 patients. It would be great to use this algorithm on an enormous population, for example, 10 million people, and check the true positive rate versus the false positive rate. Apart from these limitations, we are now publicly providing our dataset as well as codes so that other researchers could use these as a starting point and propose a new algorithm to predict diabetes and compare it with our results. One of the recommendations is that, as we have applied machine learning and their ensembles, it would be great to explore modern deep learning techniques."
35139846,Diabetes mellitus risk prediction in the presence of class imbalance using flexible machine learning methods,"Early detection and prediction of type two diabetes mellitus incidence by baseline measurements could reduce associated complications in the future. The low incidence rate of diabetes in comparison with non-diabetes makes accurate prediction of minority diabetes class more challenging. Deep neural network (DNN), extremely gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest (RF) performance is compared in predicting minority diabetes class in Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) cohort data. The impact of changing threshold, cost-sensitive learning, over and under-sampling strategies as solutions to class imbalance have been compared in improving algorithms performance. DNN with the highest accuracy in predicting diabetes, 54.8%, outperformed XGBoost and RF in terms of AUROC, g-mean, and f1-measure in original imbalanced data. Changing threshold based on the maximum of f1-measure improved performance in g-mean, and f1-measure in three algorithms. Repeated edited nearest neighbors (RENN) under-sampling in DNN and cost-sensitive learning in tree-based algorithms were the best solutions to tackle the imbalance issue. RENN increased ROC and Precision-Recall AUCs, g-mean and f1-measure from 0.857, 0.603, 0.713, 0.575 to 0.862, 0.608, 0.773, 0.583, respectively in DNN. Weighing improved g-mean and f1-measure from 0.667, 0.554 to 0.776, 0.588 in XGBoost, and from 0.659, 0.543 to 0.775, 0.566 in RF, respectively. Also, ROC and Precision-Recall AUCs in RF increased from 0.840, 0.578 to 0.846, 0.591, respectively. G-mean experienced the most increase by all imbalance solutions. Weighing and changing threshold as efficient strategies, in comparison with resampling methods are faster solutions to handle class imbalance. Among sampling strategies, under-sampling methods had better performance than others.","We studied three powerful machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes incidence in the future based on some demographic, biochemical, and anthropometric measures. To tackle minority diabetes class imbalance, we used three strategies. Changing threshold as a simple strategy, cost-sensitive learning and sampling which involve more searching to fit optimal algorithm, are applied. We evaluated the performance of algorithms before and after providing a solution to the imbalance issue by examining various metrics. Each metric focuses on a special aspect of performance. Except ROC and P-R AUCs, all metrics are constructed based on confusion matrix. Accuracy is consistently decreased after applying imbalance solutions, while g-mean as unbiased metric in imbalanced data [29] is raised substantially. Other metrics had variable behavior. Our results show that changing threshold based on value that maximizes f1-measure, improved f1-measure, g-mean, and MCC (except for random forest) in three investigated algorithms. In changing threshold approach, the algorithm is not refitted. As a consequence, training time is reduced in comparison with other strategies which imply new hyper-parameters. This effortless solution could have comparable results with other solutions [34]. Our study also demonstrates its efficiency. Although, ROC and P-R AUCs remain constant, for a powerful trained algorithm changing threshold could be a first solution to enhance overall performance and to increase prediction accuracy in minority diabetes class. For tree-based algorithms, XGBoost and random forest, cost-sensitive learning was the best approach based on f1-measure and g-mean. Besides, it had good results in DNN. In comparison with sampling strategies, weighing only has one hyper-parameter which should be tuned. As a result, the complexity of the training procedure and run-time are lower than sampling methods. By increasing the weight of minority diabetes class, sensitivity is consistently increased but on the other hand, specificity is decreased [39, 40]. Usually, to address the imbalance problem, sampling strategies are applied [41Ð43]. We studied five sampling methods. Among sampling strategies, one of the under-sampling methods outperformed over-sampling and hybrid procedures based on f1-measure and g-mean in all algorithms. Although in comparison with original data, sampling resulted in better performance, they were not the best solution to solve imbalance distribution between diabetic and healthy classes. Only for DNN, sampling method outperformed other approaches. Sampling strategies have multiple hyper-parameters that should be tuned precisely. Overall, in original imbalanced data, DNN had highest accuracy for minority diabetes class and outperformed other classifiers based on mean of metrics. After giving solution to class imbalance, in terms of AUROC and AUPRC, under-sampled DNN and weighted XGBoost were better performers, respectively, among combination of algorithms and solving imbalance problem approaches. One of the applied advantages of XGBoost is its ability to model data with missing values which is a common case in medical data [27]. In addition, it is trained very fast and as a powerful algorithm, it has attracted attention in modeling challenging data [44, 45]. One limitation of our work is the low number of investigated sampling methods. SMOTE oversampling is frequently applied to handle class imbalance [12], but in our study, it was not the best performer. A possible explanation for this could be the high overlap between two classes in our data. Applying SMOTE could result in more ambiguous borderline between diabetes and non-diabetes classes. To explore the efficiency of sampling strategies, we will study a larger number of methods in the future with other datasets."
37430572,Prediction of Diabetes Mellitus Progression Using Supervised Machine Learning,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DN) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) that can lead to foot ulceration and eventual amputation if not treated properly. Therefore, detecting DN early is important. This study presents an approach for diagnosing various stages of the progression of DM in lower extremities using machine learning to classify individuals with prediabetes (PD; n = 19), diabetes without (D; n = 62), and diabetes with peripheral neuropathy (DN; n = 29) based on dynamic pressure distribution collected using pressure-measuring insoles. Dynamic plantar pressure measurements were recorded bilaterally (60 Hz) for several steps during the support phase of walking while participants walked at self-selected speeds over a straight path. Pressure data were grouped and divided into three plantar regions: rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. For each region, peak plantar pressure, peak pressure gradient, and pressure-time integral were calculated. A variety of supervised machine learning algorithms were used to assess the performance of models trained using different combinations of pressure and non-pressure features to predict diagnoses. The effects of choosing various subsets of these features on the model's accuracy were also considered. The best performing models produced accuracies between 94-100%, showing the proposed approach can be used to augment current diagnostic methods.","The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using supervised machine learning algorithms to accurately classify persons who are diagnosed with pre-diabetes, diabetes, or diabetes with peripheral neuropathy. The classification accuracies, as well as the false negative rates for DN in the test dataset, were used to determine which algorithms and features subsets performed best. The false negative rates for DN participants are especially important because of the difficulty in diagnosing DN using current techniques. Table 5 indicates that all datasets yielded reasonably accurate classifications. However, since false negative rates are important for this type of analysis, it is reasonable to consider dataset 1 and datasets 11 through 14; all had zero percent false negative rates. Of these five datasets, datasets 13 and 14 had the highest F1 score, of 100%. The results may indicate that a subset of the tested features can be more successful in classification than using all available features. A recent study that used biomechanical data to train and test machine learning algorithms for DN diagnosis also found that using a subset of features, rather than the entire dataset, yielded greater accuracies [32]. Thus, the identification and inclusion of significant features, rather than all available features, could produce more effective and less computationally costly algorithms. The only pressure features in datasets 13 and 14 were for PTI. This indicates that PTI may play a significant role in DN classification. A previous study indicated that rearfoot values of peak pressure are significant in classification [22]. PPP has also been reported to be a significant indicator for DN [17,22]. This was corroborated in this study by the high performance of datasets 9 and 10, which relied solely on PPP pressure features, and datasets 5 and 6, which used PPP and PTI features. For these specific datasets, ensemble bagged trees and ensemble subspace KNN classifiers produced the best classifications of the data. It is also of note that subspace KNN was the second-best performing algorithm for five of the seven datasets where it was not the best performing, excepting only datasets 3 and 7. Table 5 also indicates that the exclusion of HbA1c did not yield any significant difference in results. Testing only the non-pressure features, with and without HbA1c, resulted in 100% in all three measures. This may be because during data collection, while the pressure values would change for each trial, the non-pressure features for each participant would remain the same, since the measures were not variable during a single data collection session. As such, the current dataset did not produce any significant trends or results when looking only at the non-pressure features. No trends in the non-pressure features when plotted across the three classes were found, either. Since the non-pressure features did not have any discernable pattern in delineating the three classes, it could not be concluded that non-pressure features are all that is needed to classify individuals with PD, D, or DN, and further exploration into the impact of these features on classification was unfruitful. The non-pressure features alone were thus concluded to not have the ability to accurately classify the data. Analyzing solely the pressure features allowed the features that played a more significant role in accurate classification to become clearer. The results of analyzing only the pressure features (Table 6) indicate that datasets 1, 5, 7, and 13 had test accuracies of greater than 80% and false negative rates of less than 3%. It should be noted that dataset 1 included all pressure features; dataset 5 had PPP and PTI features; dataset 7 combined PPG and PTI features; and dataset 13 only contained PTI features. The recurrence of PTI indicated its significance in classifying the progression of diabetes. When considering only pressure features, the results indicated that including more features does produce a higher test accuracy, but only when PTI features are included. For example, dataset 3, which included PPP and PPG features, achieved a test accuracy of 65% and false negative rate of 39%. Similarly, dataset 9 included only PPP features, and dataset 11 only included PPG features. All of these datasets produced test accuracies of less than 70% and false negative rates of greater than 50%. Overall, the inclusion of PTI, even as the sole pressure feature, greatly enhanced all three measures. The results from Table 6 indicate that a variety of pressure features used alone can still provide adequately accurate classifications, as datasets 1 and 5 had precision, recall, and F1 scores of higher than 90%. By comparing the results from Table 5 and Table 6, however, it can be seen that if using only a limited number of pressure features, having non-pressure features will greatly enhance the feasibility of this method, exemplified best by the drastic performance difference in dataset 11. A study that used center of pressure data to train and test a deep clustering model found that individuals with DN tend to apply less force while walking and have longer stance times during gait [33]. As such, individuals who have DN might have values for PPG or PPP similar to those of the other classes, but their PTI values are more distinct, since the feature combines pressure, foot size (due to the increased number of sensors for larger insoles), and time. Additionally, since PTI represents the combined effect of these three factors, it can avoid the variability due to gait variation better than PPP or PPG. Given the high presence of PTI in the best performing algorithms, further study into the relationship between foot size, walking speed, and PTI is desirable. Table 7 shows that PCA achieved comparable results for the best datasets of Table 5: datasets 1 and 11 through 14. The results that were achieved using ensemble classifier with subspace KNN model produced the highest results in conjunction with PCA. Apart from datasets 8, 9, and 12Ð14, PCA also led to higher false negative rates. While dimensionality reduction was explored to see if the model performance could be enhanced, the results indicate that PCA was unsuccessful in this. While ensemble classifier with bagged trees was a high performing algorithm throughout the results, various forms of KNN also performed well for half of the datasets (Table 5). KNN performing well has been documented before in a previous study that also analyzed multiple algorithms in classifying DN using EMG and gait data [34]."
35238791,Using Momentary Assessment and Machine Learning to Identify Barriers to Self-management in Type 1 Diabetes: Observational Study,"For adolescents living with type 1 diabetes (T1D), completion of multiple daily self-management tasks, such as monitoring blood glucose and administering insulin, can be challenging because of psychosocial and contextual barriers. These barriers are hard to assess accurately and specifically by using traditional retrospective recall. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) uses mobile technologies to assess the contexts, subjective experiences, and psychosocial processes that surround self-management decision-making in daily life. However, the rich data generated via EMA have not been frequently examined in T1D or integrated with machine learning analytic approaches. The goal of this study is to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of missed self-management in young adults with T1D. To achieve this goal, we train and compare a number of machine learning models through a learned filtering architecture to explore the extent to which EMA data were associated with the completion of two self-management behaviors: mealtime self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and insulin administration. We analyzed data from a randomized controlled pilot study using machine learning-based filtering architecture to investigate whether novel information related to contextual, psychosocial, and time-related factors (ie, time of day) relate to self-management. We combined EMA-collected contextual and insulin variables via the MyDay mobile app with Bluetooth blood glucose data to construct machine learning classifiers that predicted the 2 self-management behaviors of interest. With 1231 day-level SMBG frequency counts for 45 participants, demographic variables and time-related variables were able to predict whether daily SMBG was below the clinical threshold of 4 times a day. Using the 1869 data points derived from app-based EMA data of 31 participants, our learned filtering architecture method was able to infer nonadherence events with high accuracy and precision. Although the recall score is low, there is high confidence that the nonadherence events identified by the model are truly nonadherent. Combining EMA data with machine learning methods showed promise in the relationship with risk for nonadherence. The next steps include collecting larger data sets that would more effectively power a classifier that can be deployed to infer individual behavior. Improvements in individual self-management insights, behavioral risk predictions, enhanced clinical decision-making, and just-in-time patient support in diabetes could result from this type of approach.","To better understand the factors affecting the self-management behavior of adolescents with T1D, this study applied machine learning analyses to construct an LFA using demographic, BG, and momentary psychosocial and self-management data. The relative association of the 5 domains of variables for the predictability of self-management behaviors was compared using all the variables collectively as the benchmark. For the demographic data, the results indicated that demographics were most associated with average daily SMBG frequency. These results highlight the value of social determinants of health, as defined by demographics. Although demographic factors are generally not modifiable, social determinants of health are increasingly used to adapt care to those who are most vulnerable and may not receive the full benefit of current approaches to health care [36,37]. The EMA data were able to infer nonadherence to SMBG and insulin with high accuracy and precision. Although the recall score was low, there was high confidence that the nonadherence events identified by the model are truly nonadherent. A reason for the lower recall score has to do with the small data sets that have disparities in the frequencies of observed classes or outcomes. Nonetheless, this study shows promise in the collection of larger data sets that would more effectively power a classifier that is deployable in the real world. These results also concord with our reported results from the initial statistical analysis in that (1) demographic features are correlated with daily SMBG frequencies; (2) features from each group, except for time points, have a statistically significant impact on SMBG; and (3) features from each group, except for social context, have statistically significant inferential power on insulin administration. These results support the feasibility and value of integrating EMA and machine learning to improve behavioral assessment and automate behavioral pattern recognition in health care [18,38]. Our learned models show promise in quantifying the impact of psychosocial factors on self-management. In diabetes, stress and mood are modifiable factors that may be positively influenced by coping and problem-solving interventions [39,40]. The use of machine learning and EMA was also seen in a recent study on tinnitus (the phantom perception of sounds), where an RF classifier was applied on EMA data collected from the TrackYourTinnitus mobile app across devices to predict the mobile operating system used [41]. Social context also provided a framework for understanding risk and may be modified by interventions focused on social competence and problem solving [39]. In previous studies [42,43], behavioral observations were used to identify patterns of hand hygiene compliance monitoring, from which we obtained useful initial insights into which domains of variables had the most impact on compliance behavior. Moving forward, the use of primarily intensive self-reported and passive psychosocial and behavioral data streams combined with machine learning could provide the basis for population-based monitoring systems to help guide automated pattern detection for clinical risk management. For example, experimental unobtrusive indicators of mealtimes are in development [44], and insulin administration is available via pumps [44]. If successful, additional passive data streams would greatly improve our methodological rigor and reach [45]. The LFA machine learning methods used here should be applied to a large, diverse sample of patients to confirm and expand the results reported in this paper. Although passive methods are increasingly used to infer behavior and psychosocial status [46,47], there are important subjective experiences, such as mood, which may continue to require self-reporting. For the foreseeable future, both self-reported real-time data and passive data, such as social networking [48], may be integrated to optimize insights for health care. Prior research using traditional retrospective questionnaire methods has focused largely on identifying psychosocial correlates and predictors of self-management in chronic illness in general and specifically in diabetes [9]. With a few exceptions, little research using EMA has been conducted on diabetes. The few studies conducted have uniquely identified time-based factors, such as time of day and momentary negative mood, as related to self-management behaviors [49-51]. Machine learning analyses have been applied in various studies, focusing largely on the improvement of diabetes management and control. Earlier studies have constructed and fine-tuned different machine learning models to predict future BG levels based on historical physiological data [52-54], detect incorrect BG measurements [55], predict hypoglycemia [56,57], and manage insulin dosing [58] and applied it to provide lifestyle support integrating food recognition and energy expenditure [59,60]. The study results reported here advance the assessment and analysis of factors previously associated with self-management, including stress [49], mood [61,62], stigma [9,63], and social contexts [8,12]. Our study also uniquely assesses novel factors not previously studied in the T1D population, such as fatigue [64], location [65], social contexts [8], and contextual factors, such as rushing and traveling. The collected EMA data have a promising ability to infer the 2 diabetes self-management behaviors under study. This study had several limitations. First, although intensive assessment resulted in a substantial number of observations per participant, the number of participants was relatively small. Although the inferential ability of this data was identified during our empirical analysis, a larger sample size in future iterations will help produce higher quality results. Second, some of the data collected here using momentary self-report, such as stress, may eventually become available as feasible passive data streams. This could reduce the burden of momentary assessment for participants and enhance the accuracy and reliability of the data. Consideration of burden should influence behavioral sampling strategies and research designs using momentary assessment. Finally, this study used a self-report of insulin administration. Moving forward, integration of insulin pumps or automated insulin administration systems will be necessary to infer insulin dosing and timing accurately."
36465642,Machine learning models to predict in-hospital mortality in septic patients with diabetes,"Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Up to now, there are no well-established longitudinal networks from molecular mechanisms to clinical phenotypes in sepsis. Adding to the problem, about one of the five patients presented with diabetes. For this subgroup, management is difficult, and prognosis is difficult to evaluate. From the three databases, a total of 7,001 patients were enrolled on the basis of sepsis-3 standard and diabetes diagnosis. Input variable selection is based on the result of correlation analysis in a handpicking way, and 53 variables were left. A total of 5,727 records were collected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database and randomly split into a training set and an internal validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Then, logistic regression with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost were conducted to build the predictive model by using training set. Then, the models were tested by the internal validation set. The data from eICU Collaborative Research Database (n = 815) and dtChina critical care database (n = 459) were used to test the model performance as the external validation set. In the internal validation set, the accuracy values of logistic regression with lasso regularization, Bayes logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost were 0.878, 0.883, 0.865, 0.883, and 0.882, respectively. Likewise, in the external validation set 1, lasso regularization = 0.879, Bayes logistic regression = 0.877, decision tree = 0.865, random forest = 0.886, and XGBoost = 0.875. In the external validation set 2, lasso regularization = 0.715, Bayes logistic regression = 0.745, decision tree = 0.763, random forest = 0.760, and XGBoost = 0.699. The top three models for internal validation set were Bayes logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, whereas the top three models for external validation set 1 were random forest, logistic regression, and Bayes logistic regression. In addition, the top three models for the external validation set 2 were decision tree, random forest, and Bayes logistic regression. Random forest model performed well with the training and three validation sets. The most important features are age, albumin, and lactate.","Both ROC curves and PR curves provide a diagnostic tool to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. ROC curves visualize the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR). However, PR-AUC focuses on precision (PPV) and recall (TPR) (17). Because of this, although there is some disturbance of the proportion of positive and negative samples in the test set changes, the ROC curve can remain unchanged (18). This consistency of the ROC in the face of class imbalance reflects its ability to measure the predictive performance of a model itself, which is independent of the proportion of the positive and negative samples. Otherwise, compared with ROC curves, PRC curves retain the sensibility to the change of proportion (15, 19Ð21). Hence, in case of imbalance between the positive and negative sample ratios, PRC is more responsive to the goodness of the classifier than ROC. It is the reason why, in this research, we use PR-AUC to present our results. We analyzed a dataset composed of clinical data from 7,001 patients in the East and the West. Gender ratio in this present study is 3:4 (female:male), and the ratio does not show appreciable differences among different datasets. On the other hand, it seems like there is no relationship between gender and outcome, according to the results of PearsonÕs chi-squared test with YatesÕ continuity correction. The average age is 67.8 ± 13.4, and, according to not only the two feature importance score plots but also the rest predictor, age is a statistically crucial predictor variable of decease. For the elder people, even if without underlying diseases, sepsis is a critical health issue and a major cause of admission to ICU (22). Furthermore, older patients suffer longer length of stay in ICU and higher case fatality rates (23). More prolonged proinflammatory responses may count for much. Aging, on the other hand, is one of the nonmodifiable factors that contribute to the increased incidence of diabetes. It is suggested that aging and lower vascular telomere length in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (24) converge to endothelial dysfunction, which is an indicator of sepsis severity. Lactate, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase, is a product of glucose metabolism. In our research, it is one of the most important variables of in-hospital mortality prediction for patients with sepsis with diabetes. In clinical use, the serum level of lactate is commonly included in management of patients with sepsis because of the impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase in sepsis. According to the sepsis-3 guidelines, septic shock should be clinically defined in case of persistence of a serum lactate more than 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation (1). The high lactate concentrations are suggested to be a predictor of mortality. Meanwhile, the lower lactate levels are related to improved clinical outcomes (25). Mechanically, some research studies indicated that the extracellular lactate may have important regulatory effects on a variety of immune cells (26). There is view that aerobic glycolytic metabolism is important to initiate immune cells (27). Compared with non-diabetic ones, the patients with diabetes have higher plasma lactate levels even in the prediabetes stage and hyperinsulinemia condition. Intriguingly, there is some evidence to indicate that lactate can be used to predict the occurrence of diabetes (28, 29). However, there is no research study that reveals direct association between sepsis and diabetes via lactate, especially for lactate, in metabolism disorder; a question remained: cause or consequence or both? In this study, all the predictors are performed on the basis of the albumin levels. Classically, albumin levels reflect the nutritional status and organic function of patient. A research revealed that patients with low albumin had higher mortality and longer length of hospital stays than patients with normal albumin, whereas patients with high albumin had lower mortality and shorter hospital stays (30). Intriguingly, a prospective observational study concluded that hypoalbuminemia during sepsis was caused by enhanced clearance from the circulation instead of dysfunction of the liver (31). Moreover, ischemia modified albumin cloud be an effective diagnosis marker of neonatal sepsis (32). Holistically, we noticed the performance level in the Chinese validation dataset decreased. Owing to the limit to the size of accessible matched dataset, our attempt to train the predictor with Chinese data and to use Western data for validation failed. Although, the racial differences should be considered. There are some published research studies that reveal the increased incidence and severity of sepsis in black individuals compared with that in white individuals (33Ð35). Furthermore, an excellent research proved that APOL1 risk variants, which are specifically present in individuals of African ancestry, contribute to the exacerbated sepsis (36). From this point, the conformance of responses to sepsis between different races should not be expected."
31551457,Prognostic Modeling and Prevention of Diabetes Using Machine Learning Technique,"Stratifying individuals at risk for developing diabetes could enable targeted delivery of interventional programs to those at highest risk, while avoiding the effort and costs of prevention and treatment in those at low risk. The objective of this study was to explore the potential role of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a machine learning technique, in validating the performance of the Framingham Diabetes Risk Scoring Model (FDRSM), a well-respected prognostic model. Can HMM predict 8-year risk of developing diabetes in an individual effectively? To our knowledge, no study has attempted use of HMM to validate the performance of FDRSM. We used Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, of 172,168 primary care patients to derive the 8-year risk of developing diabetes in an individual using HMM. The Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AROC) in our study sample of 911 individuals for whom all risk factors and follow up data were available is 86.9% compared to AROCs of 78.6% and 85% reported in a previously conducted validation study of FDRSM in the same Canadian population and the Framingham study respectively. These results demonstrate that the discrimination capability of our proposed HMM is superior to the validation study conducted using the FDRSM in a Canadian population and in the Framingham population. We conclude that HMM is capable of identifying patients at increased risk of developing diabetes within the next 8-years.","The increase in T2DM incidence is the main reason for increased diabetes prevalence around the world. It has a prolonged latent phase particularly in its early period and is thus poorly controlled29. Several meta analyses and clinical trials convincingly suggest that early interventions can postpone or prevent T2DM30,31. Early identification of high risk patients even when they are in a normoglycemic state is highly desirable, since interventions to prevent diabetes take time to implement. From a clinician and payor prospective, the development of such risk assessment techniques could enable optimal allocation of resources and healthcare services with greater confidence32. Although traditional risk factors for diabetes offer general guidance, they are ineffective for individual risk assessment33. Several risk scoring models have been widely investigated to identify patients at high risk for developing T2DM as well as to communicate risk estimated effectively. Among them, the FDRSM is a well-known and widely used diabetes risk scoring model. This model was proposed to predict the 8-year risk of developing diabetes risk in middle-aged adults using 6 risk factors, including BMI, FBG, positive parental history of diabetes HDL, blood pressure and TG14. The FDRSM is primarily based on the data obtained from Framingham heart study. Technical details about the FDRSM and interactive risk calculator can be found on the Framingham heart study website (https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org). The Framingham Heart Study is the first, most comprehensively characterized multigenerational and ongoing study of its kind. It continues to provide an effective platform for the primary prevention of chronic diseases. It has contributed to a paradigm shift in the history of medicine through its community-based approach. Despite of major contributions, this observational study is consuming a lot of resources and time. In such scenarios, special-purpose techniques are required. In line with the suggestion of the original paper, the Framingham offspring study, the FDRSM risk scoring model should be tested in various populations in order to ensure its validity in local population, Mashayekhi et al.15 proposed a study to validate the performance of the FDRSM in a Canadian population. The reported AROC was 78.6%, which is fair, given that parental history of diabetes was omitted because it was not available in the CPCSSN database. However, in the present study an effort has been made (1) to develop a HMM based diagnostic predictive model for leveraging EMRs data by utilizing temporal evolution of diabetes progression captured in repeated clinical measurements obtained from a longitudinal sample of patients (2) to validate the performance of the FDRSM as well as avoid some of the above mentioned limitations in order to assist health care professionals/physicians in investigating the 8-year risk of developing T2DM in an individual with the objective to control and manage the downstream consequences of diabetes. Unlike traditional machine learning techniques, the proposed HMM model has the ability to provide explicit information about prognosis, while utilizing the inherent temporal dependencies present in the data, and which is required to characterize disease risk and progression over time. Our comparative analysis using a dataset with and without age, demonstrates that age does exhibit a significant association with diabetes risk, as slight under performance does occur when age is excluded from the dataset. Unfortunately, this finding does not provide much guidance for T2DM prevention as age, along with sex, are non-modifiable risk factors. The remaining risk factors included in risk stratification are meaningful for the implementation of preventive and interventional measures in order to decrease the incidence of diabetes. Existing literature also highlights that modifiable risk factors contribute significantly to reduced risk of developing T2DM34. The Framingham study determined odds ratios of 1.00 and 1.15 for triglycerides and fasting blood sugar for predicting the 8-year risk of developing T2DM. The results of our study are consistent with the results of the Framingham study with respect to triglycerides (odds ratio 1.076 [95% CI, 0.862Ð1.343], p_<_0.005). However, in our study sample fasting blood sugar demonstrated an overly strong association with diabetes onset (9.936 [95% CI, 7.638Ð12.925], p_<_0.005). All other risk factors included in this study were also significantly associated with the incidence of diabetes. Comparative analysis of the percentage of people with low HDL levels in the Framingham research sample in Table 4 implies that the cut-off values for HDL should be revisited. Validation of a risk-score model often involves plotting observed cases verses estimated probability35. We found an overlap between observed incidence and estimated probability in our analysis. Thus, estimated risk has a certain accuracy, however discrimination is the ability of the model to differentiate between individuals who have the disease from those who do not. We included the AROC analysis to evaluate the discriminatory capability of our proposed model to identify the 8-year risk of developing T2DM. The reported AROC for the proposed study is 86.9%, which is comparatively good, given that diabetic parental history is omitted due to its unavailability in the dataset. Experimental results also demonstrated that our proposed model has the potential to effectively predict the 8-year risk of developing T2DM in an individual. These results are significant because in addition to identifying a-priori T2DM risk, this is the first study to evaluate the performance of the Framingham diabetes risk scoring model using a state of the art HMM. We believe this will motivate future investigations to apply ML methods to EMR data to assist in identifying the risk of developing various other diseases. The proposed method can be used easily by healthcare providers to identify high risk patients who may benefit from intensified prevention and intervention measures and as a result, halt or delay the onset of diabetes with reduced healthcare expenditure and improved healthcare services delivery. It is estimated that people with diabetes are 2.6 times more likely to be hospitalized in the past year than people without diabetes (21% vs. 8%)36,37. The approximate healthcare expenditure for an individual with diabetes in the US is _$16,750 per year, of which _$9,600 is the direct cost of diabetes38. Economic costs and social burden of diabetes estimated by the American Diabetes Association demonstrates that the costs of diabetes increased by approximately 200% from 2002 to 201238. Given the newly predicted high risk individuals, a substantial fraction of healthcare cost and individual disease burden in our baseline dataset could be saved if clinicians and healthcare providers manage those high risk individuals promptly. Despite the promising results, our study has several limitations. First, parental history of diabetes is missing in our model. This affects the internal validity of our proposed model. In addition, as our study sample only contains information related to those risk factors that were addressed by the FDRSM14,39,40, other risk factors incorporated in various risk scoring models are ignored (like, diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption and ethnicity). Second, the dataset used in this research is mainly obtained from a Canadian population; caution is required when generalizing these findings to other populations."
36210985,Detecting High-Risk Factors and Early Diagnosis of Diabetes Using Machine Learning Methods,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that can cause several forms of chronic damage to the human body, including heart problems, kidney failure, depression, eye damage, and nerve damage. There are several risk factors involved in causing this disease, with some of the most common being obesity, age, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Therefore, early detection of these risk factors is vital in helping patients reverse diabetes from the early stage to live healthy lives. Machine learning (ML) is a useful tool that can easily detect diabetes from several risk factors and, based on the findings, provide a decision-based model that can help in diagnosing the disease. This study aims to detect the risk factors of diabetes using ML methods and to provide a decision support system for medical practitioners that can help them in diagnosing diabetes. Moreover, besides various other preprocessing steps, this study has used the synthetic minority over-sampling technique integrated with the edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) method for balancing the BRFSS dataset. The SMOTE-ENN is a more powerful method than the individual SMOTE method. Several ML methods were applied to the processed BRFSS dataset and built prediction models for detecting the risk factors that can help in diagnosing diabetes patients in the early stage. The prediction models were evaluated using various measures that show the high performance of the models. The experimental results show the reliability of the proposed models, demonstrating that k-nearest neighbor (KNN) outperformed other methods with an accuracy of 98.38%, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC/AUC score of 98%. Moreover, compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, the results confirm the efficacy of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation measures. The use of SMOTE-ENN is more beneficial for balancing the dataset to build more accurate prediction models. This was the main reason it was possible to achieve models more accurate than the existing ones.","The dataset used in this study was preprocessed in advance but was extremely imbalanced. The data imbalance issue was handled using SMOTE-ENN, which is a more powerful method than the SMOTE method alone. Thus, several ML algorithms were applied to the processed data. For the building of each model, hyperparameter tuning was performed to choose the best fitted model architecture for detecting the high-risk factors of diabetes. After running several experiments with optimal model architecture on the processed data, and the best classifiers according to accuracy and other measures were used to report the results. In this study, the finalized classifiers for detecting the high-risk factors of diabetes are KNN, RF, XGBoost, Bagging, and AdaBoost. The results achieved by these models were also compared to the existing state-of-the-art studies, and the efficacy of our proposed methods was found to be higher in terms of testing accuracy, precision, sensitivity, f-measure, and ROC/AUC score. This shows that the proposed models can be used as a decision-making process for detecting high-risk factors for diabetes and can also help medical practitioners in diagnosing diabetes patients in the early stages. This study was conducted to provide a system that can automatically detect the risk factors of diabetes as well as to provide an automatic decision-making system that can help medical practitioners in diagnosing diabetes patients based on risk factors. For that purpose, various preprocessing methods were used to prepare the data to increase the likelihood of prediction and increase the opportunity for developing reliable models. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning was performed for the building of each model to finalize the optimal parameter set that can achieve the maximum possible accuracies. Therefore, various experiments were performed on the processed BRFSS dataset in which the finalized methods discussed in the above sections achieved the best possible results in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, f-measure, and ROC/AUC score. Among them, KNN outperformed the best-fitted model compared to others and even the state-of the art methods available in the literature. The reason behind the high performance of the proposed method was the use of the SMOTE-ENN method for handling the imbalanced dataset problem. The study has also attempted to use the SMOTE method alone, but the results were not much different from those of the existing studies. The use of SMOTE-ENN made it possible to achieve higher accuracies of the proposed models compared to the existing ones. This confirms the reliability of the proposed method for detecting the risk factors of diabetes as well as for providing accurate decision support systems for diagnosing diabetes early before it becomes chronic."
36411366,Machine learning models for prediction of HF and CKD development in early-stage type 2 diabetes patients,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF) are the first and most frequent comorbidities associated with mortality risks in early-stage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, efficient screening and risk assessment strategies for identifying T2DM patients at high risk of developing CKD and/or HF (CKD/HF) remains to be established. This study aimed to generate a novel machine learning (ML) model to predict the risk of developing CKD/HF in early-stage T2DM patients. The models were derived from a retrospective cohort of 217,054 T2DM patients without a history of cardiovascular and renal diseases extracted from a Japanese claims database. Among algorithms used for the ML, extreme gradient boosting exhibited the best performance for CKD/HF diagnosis and hospitalization after internal validation and was further validated using another dataset including 16,822 patients. In the external validation, 5-years prediction area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for CKD/HF diagnosis and hospitalization were 0.718 and 0.837, respectively. In Kaplan-Meier curves analysis, patients predicted to be at high risk showed significant increase in CKD/HF diagnosis and hospitalization compared with those at low risk. Thus, the developed model predicted the risk of developing CKD/HF in T2DM patients with reasonable probability in the external validation cohort. Clinical approach identifying T2DM at high risk of developing CKD/HF using ML models may contribute to improved prognosis by promoting early diagnosis and intervention.","Using standard statistical methods and different ML techniques, we developed four different predictive models to evaluate the risk of CKD/HF in T2DM patients without a history of CKD or CVD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to predict the risk of developing CKD/HF among patients in the early stages of T2DM, employing different ML methods. Furthermore, SHAP analyses identified several novel factors associated with the development of CKD/HF, including frequencies of outpatient visit and hospitalization. Our model was validated using a dataset different from the one used for model development. The AUROC values were generally maintained; the prediction accuracy was also supported with KaplanÐMeier analysis, which demonstrated statistically significant separation of low-risk and high-risk patients. As one of the advantages of using the ML technique, our model included variables usually not considered during clinical assessment by physicians, and it could serve as a complementary tool to identify high-risk patients, independent of the physicianÕs experience. Furthermore, visualizing patient risk could facilitate effective communication between physicians, medical staff, patients, and their families, ultimately supporting shared decision-making for optimal medical treatment. The performance of the current model was similar to that of previously reported models using ML techniques, such as the WATCH-DM risk score to predict HF at 5 years (AUROC, 0.70)28, the prediction model for DKD progression at 6 months by Fujita Health University (AUROC, 0.74)25, the KidneyIntelX risk score to predict the aggravation of DKD at 5 years (AUROC, 0.77)35, and the DKD risk prediction model in patients with T2DM and normo-albuminuria at 3 years (AUROC, 0.815)36. The model using XGB exhibited a higher predictive performance for primary outcomes in these studies31,37Ð40, consistent with that in the present study. Unlike conventional studies that predict diabetes or related complications through known risk factors41, we included more than 1,000 variables for our evaluation and chose explanatory variables that had high impact on the prediction of the outcomes. This approach is expected to help in better understanding factors other than clinical presentations associated with the development and progression of CKD and HF in patients with T2DM. We performed SHAP analysis for the most substantial data features contributing to the performance of the XGB model, which enables the interpretation of complex model outputs34. The goal of the SHAP analysis is to explain an ML modelÕs prediction by calculating the contribution of each feature to the prediction. The Shapley value is a method for showing the relative impact of each feature (or variable) that is being measured on the eventual output of the ML model by comparing the relative effect of the inputs against the average. Results revealed that age, frequency of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and loop diuretic use were associated with a high feature value. As for age and loop diuretic use, many patients had a positive distribution of SHAP, suggesting greater age and loop diuretic use as risk factors of events studied in our analyses. Generally, loop diuretics are used for patients with hypertension or volume overload, which is often caused by cardiac or renal dysfunction. The use of this class of medication may have further impacted renal function. Interestingly, below-average frequency of outpatient visits or hospitalizations was associated with the higher risk of CKD/HF diagnosis and hospitalization. This may suggest that a lack of medical attention by healthcare professionals or low treatment adherence of patients hindered the early detection of CKD or HF and that continuous medical care is important for patients with T2DM even if they are in the early stages of the disease. A relevant factor in building a clinically meaningful ML model is to use training data that accurately represent the population of interest42. Poor data representation portrays a potential demographic bias in the development of ML models42. In our study, clinical information was extracted from an administrative claims database that covers approximately 15% of the Japanese population. Demographic characteristics, including the age and sex distributions of these patients, are known to be very similar to those of national statistics in Japan. In our study, the mean values for some of our cohortÕs laboratory variables, such as glycated hemoglobin and low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were similar to those observed in a previous extensive study that included two cohorts of Japanese patients with diabetes from 2004 and 201412. Another crucial step to assess the clinical applicability, as well as the quality of a prediction model, is external validation43,44. In the present study, our model maintained AUROCs in the external validation. Additionally, we evaluated model performance by comparing the high-risk and low-risk groups identified using the best cutoff values. In the 5-year follow-up, the high-risk group exhibited a higher incidence of all outcomes. These validation results indicate the usefulness of our model as a support tool for a wide range of clinicians in the management of patients with T2DM. Patients with T2DM are at high risk for CKD and HF, and these complications have a significant impact on their prognosis14,45. However, there are not enough preventive measures nor early interventions implemented for CKD and HF in patients with T2DM, and one possible cause could be a difficulty in identifying patients at a high risk of these complications. Phenotypic and pathophysiological heterogeneity in HF is well recognized, and its initial clinical presentations are not necessarily specific to HF. In contrast, CKD can be diagnosed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate value or urinalysis data; however, patients do not show significant symptoms or signs in the early stages of the disease, which can delay the testing of renal function. Our model may contribute to increased awareness of the importance of screening for CKD and HF among clinicians, regardless of the disease duration or severity of T2DM. The algorithm used in the present study may be applicable to other disease areas, including infectious disease epidemiology, and possibly improve the analysis performance. A huge effort has been made to describe, understand, and predict the spread of infectious diseases at different spatial scales, from personal to regional and global, by using mathematical models46Ð49. One example is COVID-19, and recent studies have reported important factors for the COVID-19 pandemic, including the rate of vaccination for social spreading and ventilation conditions for indoor spreading47,48. Highly accurate analysis would be possible by using ML and selecting the most appropriate parameters in mathematical models. In addition, in the present study, we performed survival analyses and prognostic assessments. Using the algorithm used in this process as a variable selection method and using data on medical history as variables in a predictive model for the epidemic period49, we would be able to estimate the periodicity of outcome occurrence and contributing factors. This study has limitations. First, the studyÕs database included information only from DPC-covered hospitals, a system for secondary care hospitals. Considering that patients with T2DM can visit clinics or hospitals outside of the remit of DPC-covered hospitals for regular follow-up, caution should be exercised while interpreting and generalizing the results of this study. Second, as this study used a secondary database, misclassification of explanatory variables and outcomes may have occurred. Third, the databases used in this study only include in-hospital deaths, and the incidence of death may be different from other types of hospitals, such as clinics. Fourth, some data may have been underestimated because the database comprises information exclusively from a subset of hospitals. Lastly, the MDV database presents a high number of patients with missing laboratory variables."
36363525,A Machine Learning Model to Predict Length of Stay and Mortality among Diabetes and Hypertension Inpatients,"Background and Objectives: Taiwan is among the nations with the highest rates of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Hypertension (HTN). As more cases are reported each year, there is a rise in hospital admissions for people seeking medical attention. This creates a burden on hospitals and affects the overall management and administration of the hospitals. Hence, this study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict the Length of Stay (LoS) and mortality among T2DM and HTN inpatients. Materials and Methods: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), this cohort study consisted of 58,618 patients, where 25,868 had T2DM, 32,750 had HTN, and 6419 had both T2DM and HTN. We analyzed the data with different machine learning models for the prediction of LoS and mortality. The evaluation was done by plotting descriptive statistical graphs, feature importance, precision-recall curve, accuracy plots, and AUC. The training and testing data were set at a ratio of 8:2 before applying ML algorithms. Results: XGBoost showed the best performance in predicting LoS (R2 0.633; RMSE 0.386; MAE 0.123), and RF resulted in a slightly lower performance (R2 0.591; RMSE 0.401; MAE 0.027). Logistic Regression (LoR) performed the best in predicting mortality (CV Score 0.9779; Test Score 0.9728; Precision 0.9432; Recall 0.9786; AUC 0.97 and AUPR 0.93), closely followed by Ridge Classifier (CV Score 0.9736; Test Score 0.9692; Precision 0.9312; Recall 0.9463; AUC 0.94 and AUPR 0.89). Conclusions: We developed a robust prediction model for LoS and mortality of T2DM and HTN inpatients. Linear Regression showed the best performance for LoS, and Logistic Regression performed the best in predicting mortality. The results showed that ML algorithms can not only help healthcare professionals in data-driven decision-making but can also facilitate early intervention and resource planning.","Earlier, we conducted a similar study using several machine learning techniques to predict LoS and mortality for patients diagnosed with T2DM and HTN in Indonesia [29]. Our previous study had the same objectives as the current one, but it was conducted using an Indonesian insurance claim-based dataset called Indonesia Case-Based Groups (INA-CBGs) from a state-owned type B regional public hospital in Tasikmalaya, the Dr. Soekardjo Regional Public Hospital (RSUD Dr. Soekardjo), with a sample size of 4376 patients. Our current study was conducted using TaiwanÕs NHIRD data using a greater sample size of 65,037 patients. The advantage of the current study is the NHIRDÕs data, which are made up of multiple hospitals and healthcare service clinics, and it is the best representation of the national population as it covers more than 99% of the resident population of Taiwan. In comparison to our previous study results, where LR and GBM models best predicted LoS and MLP best predicted the mortality, the current study also showed that XGBoost had the best performance in predicting the patientsÕ LoS, along with RF, which had similar performance, while LoR performed the best in predicting mortality, closely followed by Ridge Classifier. The ML models in both of these two studies corroborate a good prediction of LoS and mortality among T2DM and HTN patients and hence, prove their utility in medical decision-making, patient safety, and hospital resource management. In addition to our previous study, there is an abundance of other studies in the literature that utilize ML models for the prediction of diseases. For example, two of the studies used ML approaches for the prediction of LoS or mortality in diabetic patients [30,31], but neither of these studies predicted both LoS and mortality. Compared to that, in our study, LoS and mortality were predicted in order to enhance healthcare quality. The findings from our study revealed that the majority of the patients diagnosed with T2DM and HTN were male. Our findings differed from another study done in Taiwan that showed that women were more associated with HTN [30]. Our results showed that the majority of T2DM and HTN patients fall in the age group between 58 and 80, with the youngest patient being 35 years old. A population-based cross-sectional survey also found that the majority of the population aged 60 years and above were diagnosed with HTN in Taiwan [32]. Another study forecasted that the number of cases of diabetes in people aged ³65 years will increase from 9.2 million in 2014 to 21 million in 2030 [33]. Although an increasing number of individuals with T1DM were old aged [34], this discussion of pathophysiology concerns T2DM, the most common incident and prevalent type in older age groups overwhelmingly, as older adults are at high risk for the development of T2DM due to the combined effects of increasing insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic islet function with aging. Our study revealed that the discharge status of a large number of patients with HTN and T2DM was at the end of transfer in outpatient treatment. Comorbidity was also one of the factors affecting the outcome of a patientÕs medical condition. Our findings revealed that the majority of patients with T2DM have at least three or more comorbidities, while patients with HTN have at least two comorbidities. The most common comorbidities in our study included metabolic disorders, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Another study also indicated that ischemic stroke is one of the major vascular complications of diabetes mellitus [35]. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, is the major cause of death and disability in patients with T2DM [36]. Furthermore, T2DM is associated with an increased risk of multiple coexisting medical conditions in older adults, such as cardiovascular and microvascular diseases [37,38]. A group of conditions termed geriatric syndromes also occurs at higher frequency in older adults with T2DM and may affect self-care abilities and health outcomes, including quality of life [39]. Our current findings (see Table 1) indicated that the inpatient cost of patients with T2DM exceeds patients with HTN. The findings are consistent with a study by Mutsa P. Mutowo, who also showed that there was a higher median cost and interquartile range (IQR) for DM patients compared with HTN patients [40]. In a study done in Taiwan, the risk of hospitalization and healthcare cost associated with diabetes complication severity index in TaiwanÕs NHIRD showed that inpatient costs constituted a large part of the total medical costs of DM and its complications [41]. In addition, it was found that the greater the number and severity level of T2DM complications, the higher risk of mortality and hospitalizations [42]. Furthermore, previous estimates of the costs associated with T2DM and its related problems in Taiwan have been based on (The Adapted Diabetes Complications Severity Index) DCSI scores rather than individual complications. The average inpatient LoS for T2DM patients was eight days; for HTN, it was approximately one week. Our results differ from a study done in Japan, where the mean LoS of DM patients ranged from 10.9 days to 15.1 days, depending on the patientÕs age [43]. Evaluation metrics are an integral aspect of ML, as they are used as indicators to assess the performance of ML models. The most commonly used metrics are accuracy and error rate [24]; however, these metrics are not the best measures to use if you have data that are highly imbalanced, as the overall accuracy will be biased toward the majority class regardless of the minority class, which will consequently lead to poor performance. From the literature, the majority of researchers have used oversampling since this method is capable of balancing class distributions without removing potentially critical majority examples [44]. One of the most common errors that most people make is applying oversampling to the entire original data, conducting cross-validation, and finally evaluating the model [45]. This error usually leads to building biased models and producing over-optimistic error estimates. One of the strengths of our study is that we performed a combination of oversampling (SMOTE) and under-sampling methods. This procedure was applied during nested and non-nested cross-validation, the dataset was first divided into k stratified partitions, and only the training set was oversampled. In this procedure, the observations included in the test set are never oversampled or seen by the model during the training stage, thus allowing a proper evaluation of the modelÕs capability to generalize. The top feature predictor is the displacement of a lumbar intervertebral disc in patients, which ultimately results in higher LoS and mortality. Several studies have been conducted in this area; for example, Sakellaridis et al. proved that patients operated on for lumbar disk disease have a statistically significant increased incidence of diabetes mellitus compared to similar patients operated on for other reasons [46]."
35124096,Population-centric risk prediction modeling for gestational diabetes mellitus: A machine learning approach,"The heterogeneity in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) risk factors among different populations impose challenges in developing a generic prediction model. This study evaluates the predictive ability of existing UK NICE guidelines for assessing GDM risk in Singaporean women, and used machine learning to develop a non-invasive predictive model. Data from 909 pregnancies in Singapore's most deeply phenotyped mother-offspring cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO), was used for predictive modeling. We used a CatBoost gradient boosting algorithm, and the Shapley feature attribution framework for model building and interpretation of GDM risk attributes. UK NICE guidelines showed poor predictability in Singaporean women [AUC:0.60 (95% CI 0.51, 0.70)]. The non-invasive predictive model comprising of 4 non-invasive factors: mean arterial blood pressure in first trimester, age, ethnicity and previous history of GDM, greatly outperformed [AUC:0.82 (95% CI 0.71, 0.93)] the UK NICE guidelines. The UK NICE guidelines may be insufficient to assess GDM risk in Asian women. Our non-invasive predictive model outperforms the current state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict GDM, is easily accessible and can be an effective approach to minimize the economic burden of universal testing & GDM associated healthcare in Asian populations.","Our findings using the UK NICE model established the need for an improved GDM predictor in an Asian population, such as in Singapore. We observed that the risk factors in UK NICE guidelines had poor GDM predictive ability for the Singapore population (AUC:0.60). The lowering of the obesity BMI thresholds applicable to Asian women did not significantly improve the UK NICE model. We subsequently developed a two-tier GDM prediction panel that significantly outperformed the UK NICE guidelines. The first-tier GDM prediction panel is non-invasive and requires no fasting (AUC:0.82). The 4 features used in the non-invasive model can be easily measured and assessed during first trimester (mean arterial blood pressure at booking appointment, maternal age, previous history of GDM and ethnicity). Elevated mean arterial blood pressure at booking can be an early pregnancy sign of vulnerability to the metabolic syndrome of which insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism are prominent components. The case-control study by Savvidou et al provides further support to our finding, where GDM women had higher systolic blood pressure in early pregnancy [21]. Hedderson et al reported similar findings, where high blood pressure in pregravid and early pregnancy states were associated with an increased risk of GDM [22]. As blood pressure is a vital sign measured routinely at antenatal visits, mean arterial blood pressure is an easy and inexpensive clinical characteristic which can be used for GDM screening. Despite the evidence that GDM risk increases with age [23], higher maternal age is not included as one of the risk factors in UK NICE screening guidelines. This is particularly important keeping in mind that insulin resistance increases with age. With increasing age at pregnancy becoming more common in developed and developing countries, higher maternal age is an important attribute to be considered in GDM assessment. Previous history of GDM serves as an early approach to GDM surveillance. The importance of GDM history is supported by substantial epidemiologic evidence. In a recent meta-analysis by Lee et al, women with a previous history of GDM had an 8.42-fold increased risk of developing GDM when compared with women without a previous history of GDM [24]. Studies on racial-ethnic differences in GDM risk have shown that Asians are a heterogeneous group by genetic background, culture, diet and other lifestyle factors [25]. The UK NICE guidelines classify Indian ethnic women to be at high risk for GDM in SingaporeÕs population. In our study, we have shown that Chinese women are also at similar risk for GDM. With these findings, ethnicity-tailored preventive local programmes can be developed to improve the health literacies of GDM in high risk Chinese/Indian communities. In our non-invasive GDM prediction panel, the addition of mean arterial blood pressure, maternal age, previous history of GDM and ethnicity resulted in a significant performance improvement (_AUC=+0.26) when compared with the risk stratification model on previous GDM history. The 4 features in our non-invasive ÔNI4Õ model have demonstrated stronger GDM predictive ability than the UK NICE model, suggesting that further improvements can be made in current risk assessment guidelines for GDM. The machine learning algorithm (LightGBM gradient boosting classifier) trained by Artzi et al achieved an impressive AUC of 0.80 with 9 questionnaire features for GDM detection [13]. However, questionnaire features may introduce recall bias in predictive modelling (e.g. highest value of HbA1c% measured from previous pregnancy, results of OGTT from previous pregnancy). In another study by Wu et al [14], the machine learning algorithm (logistic regression classifier) achieved an AUC of 0.77 with 7 clinical features for early GDM prediction. The invasive model developed by Wu et al requires the measurement of fasting glucose, HbA1c and triglycerides. Our first-tier, non-invasive GDM prediction model has an improved performance (CatBoost model AUC:0.82) with 4 non-invasive features collected at first trimester, outperforming the current state-of-the-art machine learning models. The first-tier, non-invasive GDM prediction model can thus be an effective approach to screen and intervene early in women at risk, and also minimize the economic burden of universal testing and GDM associated healthcare in Asian populations. The second-tier panel is invasive and requires more advanced laboratory testing, which may not be routinely available in all standard clinical laboratories. Adiponectin contributed to a better performance improvement than IGF1. With adiponectin included, the predictive performance of the non-invasive panel can only be marginally enhanced [CatBoost ÔNI4_ADIÕ model AUC:0.84 (95% CI 0.75, 0.93)]. Lower adiponectin concentrations are associated with visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and plays a critical role in metabolism [26]. Visceral fat accumulation is one possible pathophysiological mechanism in GDM development. Although pre-pregnancy obesity is the second most important feature in UK NICE model, pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI>=30 kg/m2) was of low global importance in CatBoost feature selection model (Fig. 2). As further evidenced by the stronger predictive ability of adiponectin, visceral fat accumulation (intra-abdominal fat) may be a better marker of adiposity in Asians. Increased dairy consumption in mid-gestation added minimal predictive value to second-tier panel [CatBoost ÔNI4_ADI_DIÕ model AUC:0.85 (95% CI 0.79, 0.92)]. Dairy consumption in GUSTO cohort study was derived from milk, yoghurt, cheese, milk-based malt drinks and cultured yoghurt drinks. Our dietary finding can be explained by general food consumption patterns during pregnancy, where dairy and dairy product consumption is greatest during mid-pregnancy. In the study by Tucker et al, high dairy intake was a strong predictor of insulin resistance in women without diabetes [27]. As mid-pregnancy is a critical window period for GDM development, dairy intake during pregnancy might be a modifiable GDM risk factor. With the two-tier GDM prediction panel, we have shown that model prediction can be slightly enhanced by incorporating features gathered during the course of gestation. We also have a well-defined validation framework in the study as the two-tier GDM prediction panel was compared against UK NICE guidelines. An added strength of the study is the utilization of SHAP framework to interpret machine learning model outputs and design a GDM prediction panel. This study has several limitations. Firstly, unlike large sample sizes in EHR databases, our prediction models were trained on a limited cohort of 909 pregnancies. However, EHR databases have inherent biases and are influenced by the individualÕs interaction with local healthcare systems. With the prospective cohort study design, GUSTO data captures the dynamic nature of complex clinical pathways and is less prone to differential measurement errors. Secondly, the WHO 1999 GDM diagnostic criteria was in effect during two-point OGTT assessment in GUSTO study (fasting, 2-hour glucose measures). International Association of Diabetes Study Groups (IADPSG) 2018 has a less stringent criterion than WHO 1999, requiring just one abnormal glucose measure during a 2-hour 75g OGTT (fasting, 1-hour, 2-hour glucose measures). Tan et al reported that about one-third of GDM cases in KKH were diagnosed based on 1-hour glucose value [28]. The lack of 1-hour glucose measure for full three-point IADPSG 2018 criteria in GUSTO study may underestimate GDM prevalence and affect model training (AUC metric of 0.71 for modified two-point IADPSG 2018 criteria is still indicative of predictive power). As supervised machine learning models are limited by the quality of ground truth to learn underlying patterns in data, the WHO 1999 criteria was a better ground truth labeler for training GDM algorithms using GUSTO cohort data. Thirdly, there may be biases in the predictive value of dairy-intake in GDM risk assessment, as this measure was derived from 24-hour dietary recall. Single day intake of dietary measure is subject to recall bias and day-to-day variation. A more accurate assessment of long term dietary patterns is required in the future to build strength in the predictive value of this measure. There is also a limitation of sample size on population genomic analyses (with < 1000 samples in GUSTO study). However, key variants and iOmics analyses in GUSTO cohort have identified IGF locus and blood measures of IGF to be associated with GDM. We hence used direct measures of plasma IGF in the current analysis. Lastly, the GUSTO cohort does not contain information of preconception parameters. With preconception data, we can possibly predict the risk of GDM during pregnancy initiation and intervene with early-stage nutritional & lifestyle changes. The longitudinal research in SingaporeÕs PREconception study of Long-Term Maternal and Child Outcomes (S-PRESTO) birth cohort study [29], may become the basis for preconception-based GDM prediction panels to be built in the future. Our first-tier, non-invasive predictive model would enable earlier interventions for GDM prevention and institution of earlier screening. Our machine learning tool can also be offered to pregnant women who are unwilling to have glucose challenge test taken. The trained GDM classifier can be deployed using a web application, where clinicians can enter patient information and obtain GDM risk prediction. The AI prediction model needs to be validated further using data from external cohorts or electronic health records in Singapore/Asia before deploying in local healthcare systems. A robust clinical evaluation via a randomized controlled trial is required to investigate the associations of the AI prediction tool with maternal and fetal outcomes."
37440591,Machine learning-based identification and related features of depression in patients with diabetes mellitus based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: A cross-sectional study,"Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are twice as likely as nondiabetic individuals to develop depression, which is a prevalent but often undiagnosed psychiatric comorbidity. Patients with DM who are depressed have poor glycemic control, worse quality of life, increased risk of diabetic complications, and higher mortality rate. The present study aimed to develop machine learning (ML) models that identify depression in patients with DM, determine the best performing model by evaluating multiple ML algorithms, and investigate features related to depression. We developed six ML models, including random forest, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting, light gradient-boosting machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The results showed that the SVM model performed well, with a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.835 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.730-0.901). Thirteen features were related to depression in patients with DM. Permutation feature importance showed that the most important feature was subjective health status, followed by level of general stress awareness; stress recognition rate; average monthly income; triglyceride (mg/dL) level; activity restriction status; European quality of life (EuroQoL): usual activity and lying in a sickbed in the past 1 month; EuroQoL: pain / discomfort, self-care, and physical discomfort in the last 2 weeks; and EuroQoL: mobility and chewing problems. The current findings may offer clinicians a better understanding of the relationship between DM and depression using ML approaches and may be an initial step toward developing a more predictive model for the early detection of depressive symptoms in patients with DM.","This study aimed to create ML models that can identify depression in patients with DM and to determine the best-performing model by assessing multiple ML algorithms while investigating features related to depression. The results showed that the SVM model had the best performance (cross-validated AUC, 0.835). The following 13 features were identified as important for classifying depression in patients with DM: subjective health status, followed by level of general stress awareness; stress recognition rate; average monthly income; triglyceride level (mg/dL); activity restriction status; EuroQoL: usual activity and lying in a sickbed in the past 1 month; EuroQoL: pain / discomfort, self-care, and physical discomfort in the last 2 weeks; and EuroQoL: mobility and chewing problems. Permutation feature importance revealed that subjective health status was the most significant features of the model. A previous study demonstrated that patients with diabetes had lower self-perceived health, psychological well-being, and quality of life compared with those without diabetes. Factors that contribute to this include being female, having depression, not exercising, and being obese [25]. Another study indicated a weak relationship between HbA1c level and quality of life. However, symptoms of depression in T2DM are associated with a significantly worse health status and quality of life [26]. Thus, the importance of caring for both DM and depression lies in improving individualsÕ quality of life and perception of their health status. The current findings, which include a large sample size and the use of ML algorithms, support the findings of previous studies. The present ML model suggests that stress awareness and average monthly income are important features for classifying depression in individuals with diabetes. Being diagnosed with diabetes, planning suicide for a year, receiving counseling for mental problems for a year, and being aware of stress significantly impacted the level of depression [27]. The risk of DM is significantly higher in lower-income groups than in higher-income groups [28]. Additionally, lower personal income was associated with major depression and depressive symptoms among adults with DM [29]. A Danish nationwide study revealed the notable prevalence of emotional problems among adults with early-onset T2DM [30]. The primary cause of those problems was attributed to perceived stress or depressive symptoms linked to socio-economic factors such as unemployment, low education level, and living alone. The ML model confirms that stress awareness and average monthly income are important features for classifying depression in individuals with diabetes. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize specialized care for stress management, considering the social status of individuals, to address both diabetes and depressive symptoms effectively. Another important feature to classify depression in patients with DM is activity restrictions, including quality of life in usual activity, lying in a sickbed in the past 1 month, and activity restriction status. DM and depression generally have a negative effect on patient-initiated activities, such as less physical activity, unhealthy diet, and lower adherence to oral medications [31]. According to a systematic review and doseÐresponse meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, higher levels of physical activity were associated with a substantially lower incidence of T2DM in the general population [32]. We found that patients with diabetic complications were less likely to engage in physical activity and had poorer self-rated health compared with those without complications. In particular, the presence of DM complications, such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, foot ulceration, retinopathy, and nephropathy, can make it challenging to meet the recommended exercise [33]. Consequently, patients with DM fail to engage in appropriate self-care behaviors, including proper physical activity, because of their symptoms and complications, and less physical activity may increase the risk of depression. However, our results do not support a causal relationship between DM and depression. Further longitudinal studies are required to understand the mechanisms and causal directions of activity restriction and depression. However, when developing treatment plans for depression in patients with DM, it is essential to address both the underlying causes of activity restriction and the resulting effects on mental health. Although comparing the performance of our models may be challenging owing to dataset and analysis variations, classifying depression among patients with DM showed improved performance. The SVM algorithm had an AUC of 83.5% and an ACC of 87.9%. In a previous ML study, the AUC of logistic regression model was 81% [8], and another study showed that the model using SVM had an ACC of 96.875% to classify depression among patients with T2DM [9]. Furthermore, our modelÕs strengths lie in its potential for expansion. The KNHANES is conducted annually; therefore, our model can incorporate additional features or new data for future research or practical applications. Additionally, Boruta, an algorithm-based technique, was employed for feature selection in our ML model. It can be beneficial for recommending approaches for developing ML models to diagnose other complications associated with DM. The present dataset was cross-sectional, and there are limitations in understanding the progressive pathways of depression. According to Park, Katon [34], patients with DM who are depressed have a considerably higher risk of death, and early identification and treatment of depression may enhance health outcomes. Further studies using longitudinal data are necessary to develop a model for detecting and predicting the early stages of depression in patients with DM. Nonetheless, the results of the present study, based on various features and a larger sample size, may serve as an initial step for the development of an ML model for predicting depression at an early stage among patients with DM. The present study has some limitations. First, the KNHANES is a cross-sectional study; therefore, we could not measure the prognosis of the disease or future occurrence of depression in the sample, and the description of the causal effect is limited. Second, we acknowledge the absence of an external validation set in the present study. However, KNHANES is a cross-sectional national survey conducted annually. Therefore, in future research, it would be beneficial to utilize upcoming datasets from KNHANES for validating our model. Third, the definitions of DM and depression relied on self-reporting. Forth, patients with T1DM could be included in this study. The KNHANES does not have a question about DM type; we eliminated patients with DM who were diagnosed before the age of 30 years. Further studies are required to determine the relationship between DM and depression in patients with T1DM. Despite these limitations, the present study aimed to develop ML models that diagnose depression in patients with DM based on the KNHANES, to determine the best performing model by evaluating multiple ML algorithms, and to investigate features related to depression."
37587201,Prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus in Asian women using machine learning algorithms,"This study developed a machine learning algorithm to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) using retrospective data from 34,387 pregnancies in multi-centers of South Korea. Variables were collected at baseline, E0 (until 10 weeks' gestation), E1 (11-13 weeks' gestation) and M1 (14-24 weeks' gestation). The data set was randomly divided into training and test sets (7:3 ratio) to compare the performances of light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, with a full set of variables (original). A prediction model with the whole cohort achieved area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) values of 0.711 and 0.246 at baseline, 0.720 and 0.256 at E0, 0.721 and 0.262 at E1, and 0.804 and 0.442 at M1, respectively. Then comparison of three models with different variable sets were performed: [a] variables from clinical guidelines; [b] selected variables from Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values; and [c] Boruta algorithms. Based on model [c] with the least variables and similar or better performance than the other models, simple questionnaires were developed. The combined use of maternal factors and laboratory data could effectively predict individual risk of GDM using a machine learning model.","In this study, we developed a machine learning algorithm for prediction of GDM in Asian women, especially Korean women, according to gestational period. The XGBoost algorithm displayed better performance than the LGBM algorithm in most cohorts and at most time points. After analyzing the performance of the machine learning model with original variables, we developed three models with simplified features for clinical application. At baseline, the model with GDM risk factors recommended by ACOG displayed the lowest performance for the whole cohort and subcohorts. Although the performance of the models employing SHAP values and the Boruta algorithm was similar at each time point, the model with variables determined by the Boruta algorithm was selected for clinical application, because the number of features was less than in the model using SHAP values. Finally, we developed questionnaires for clinical application at baseline, at E0, and at M1. Because the first trimester maternal serum aneuploidy screening markers, PAPP-A and HCG, which were added as variables in E1, did not improve the prediction performance for GDM, we set the three time points for prediction as baseline, E0, and M1. As expected, the prediction performance for GDM in the M1 period, which included the results of the 50-g OGTT and HbA1C levels, displayed significant improvement, with the highest SHAP importance of these two variables. Measurement of HbA1C is not included in routine screening tests during pregnancy. However, in South Korea abdominal obesity, assessed using waist circumference in women of 20Ð49 years old, has increased from 9% in 2013 to 12.2% in 202134. In 2020, the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was reported as 14.3% and 22.5% in women of 30Ð49 years old35. Although the high SHAP importance of HbA1C might be associated with its measurement in a limited number of women, routine screening and insurance cover of HbA1C measurements need to be considered in pregnant women and/or further studies of the criteria for pregnant women who require HbA1C measurement are required. Several studies have attempted to use traditional statistical methods to predict GDM, based on risk factors33,34, but such models have not yet been employed clinically. In recent years, there have been attempts to achieve the same goal using cutting-edge, machine learning technology22,36. Some studies, like this one, have focused on predicting GDM using early pregnancy information, and the predictive power has been reflected by an AUC of 0.7Ð0.937Ð41. Although these studies included subjects from various racial backgrounds, including Asians, there was a limited number of Asian participants, and specific studies focusing on Asian women, particularly Korean women, were scarce. Therefore, the current study is significant, as GDM varies greatly across ethnicities and geographical regions, and is particularly influenced by specific regional environments41. Some studies have evaluated additional biomarkers42,43 and genetics44Ð46, in addition to the routine data collected during antenatal care. In this study, only the basic information and laboratory tests collected during routine antenatal care were used as variables, yet the machine learning models still demonstrated moderate to high performance in early and mid-pregnancy, and have the advantage of being cost-effective. Since machine learning methods are continuously evolving, numerous types of new machine learning algorithms are being developed. In this study, we used two gradient boosting algorithms. The LGBM has demonstrated good performance with bioinformatics tasks47,48, and XGBoost is fast to run and scalable, allows parallel computing, and solves many scientific problems accurately27,28,49. Following the development of a prediction model using the XGBoost algorithm with all variables included, we extracted the variables with high SHAP values or identified by the Boruta algorithm. The final simplified prediction model, which utilizes the key variables identified by the Boruta algorithm, may be more clinically practical. One limitation is that this is a retrospective study and we conducted internal validation only, in the test set. For this reason, some data are missing and there may be bias because some tests were not performed in all populations. However, this study is based on data collected from seven centers that use the same electronic health record system and that are located in various geographical locations in Korea. Thus, our study has the strength of including various regional characteristics. In order to overcome any limitations of retrospective data, prospective cohorts for validation are currently being registered. In particular, prospective data are also being collected for the top 40 variables with high importance in SHAP value, in addition to the abbreviated variables adopted from the Boruta algorithm in this analysis. Lastly, this study evaluated the model performance not only in the whole cohort, but also in subcohorts of nulliparous and multiparous women, to improve the precision in each cohort. Our findings are predicted to be a cornerstone for developing a better algorithm and identify possible future research to validate the algorithm developed in the current study."
36238678,Prevalence and Early Prediction of Diabetes Using Machine Learning in North Kashmir: A Case Study of District Bandipora,"Diabetes is one of the biggest health problems that affect millions of people across the world. Uncontrolled diabetes can increase the risk of heart attack, cancer, kidney damage, blindness, and other illnesses. Researchers are motivated to create a Machine Learning methodology that can predict diabetes in the future. Exploiting Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) is essential if healthcare professionals are able to identify diseases more effectively. In order to improve the medical diagnosis of diabetes this research explored and contrasts various MLA that can identify diabetes risk early. The research includes the analysis on real datasets such as a clinical dataset gathered from a doctor in the Indian district of Bandipora in the years April 2021-Feb2022. MLA are currently important in the healthcare sector due to their prediction abilities. Researchers are using MLA to improve disease prediction and reduce cost. In this Paper author developed a methodology using Machine Learning Algorithms for Diabetes Disease Risk Prediction in North Kashmir. Six MLA have been successfully used in the experimental study such as Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boost (GB), Decision Tree (DT), and Logistic Regression (LR). RF is the most accurate classifier with the uppermost accuracy rate of 98 percent followed by MLP (90.99%), SVM (92%), GBC (97%), DT (96%), and LR (69%), respectively, with the balanced data set. Lastly, this study enables us to effectively identify the prevalence and prediction of diabetes.","Diabetes is a serious and chronic condition. Diabetes can be detected early enough which can result in more effective treatment. This study also compares various classification models based on machine learning algorithms for predicting a patient's diabetic condition at the earliest feasible stage. After dataset balancing, classifiers' accuracy was compared. The prime objective of our research is to determine the early prediction of diabetes using the state of advanced MLA in one of the rural areas of North Kashmir. The data set employed for this experimentation was gathered from clinical professional. In the medical diagnosis, we used diabetes clinical data set with 403 instances and 11 attributes. The professionals (Prediabetes specialists) in the medical field have approved the features chosen for the early diagnosis of diabetes Prediction. The prevalence of diabetes is showing an upward trend in Bandipora Kashmir. It is recommended that using state of art algorithms for the early prediction can help in decreasing the upward trend of diabetes Six algorithms including RF, MLP, SVM, DT, GBC, and LR algorithms were utilized for this purpose amongst all algorithms we achieved RF has the highest accuracy of 98%. RF also has produced successful outcomes for several statistical metrics includes ROC Area, Recall, Precision, F-measure, and MCC. K-fold Machine Learning models such as cross-validation has been used to evaluate RF, MLP, SVM, DT, GBC, and LR. The framework utilized in this research will be applied to ensemble and hybridization Machine Learning in order to further recent research. In the future, a more comparison analysis between various datasets and their features can be conducted in order to identify all the crucial features for forecasting diabetes. To determine the best and most accurate diabetes prediction algorithm, a variety of various algorithms and combinations of algorithms can be examined."
35773898,Early Diabetes Prediction: A Comparative Study Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Most screening tests for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in use today were developed using electronically collected data from Electronic Health Record (EHR). However, developing and under-developing countries are still struggling to build EHR in their hospitals. Due to the lack of HER data, early screening tools are not available for those countries. This study develops a prediction model for early DM by direct questionnaires for a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh. Information gain technique was used to reduce irreverent features. Using selected variables, we developed logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, Nave Bayes, random forest (RF), and neural network models to predict diabetes at an early stage. RF outperformed other machine learning algorithms achieved 100% accuracy. These findings suggest that a combination of simple questionnaires and a machine learning algorithm can be a powerful tool to identify undiagnosed DM patients.","We have developed machine learning models that accurately predict DM early using simple variables. Among the six classification models, random forest showed high prediction capability in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. Random forest model outperformed both the previously published models [6,7], had the best predictive ability to identify patients at high risk for DM, and may be used to risk stratify patients with regard to their risk of DM development. Although prior studies have developed predictive models for DM, but they did not used any feature selection techniques. In the clinical practice, fewer variables are better to predict disease because it is hard to use many variables to stratify patients. Our study is the first to use feature selection techniques and used only ten variables to predict DM. As DM is often unidentified at its early stage due to its asymptomatic characteristics[8]. Therefore, itÕs really important to diagnose DM at an early stage to minimize the severity and mortality of this disease [9]. Our study shows very promising performance to identify patients at high risk of DM earlier. Implementing our model in the clinical setting can help physicians to correctly stratify patients, better disease management, and minimize comorbidity through appropriate treatment on time."
36593394,Discovery of drug-omics associations in type 2 diabetes with generative deep-learning models,"The application of multiple omics technologies in biomedical cohorts has the potential to reveal patient-level disease characteristics and individualized response to treatment. However, the scale and heterogeneous nature of multi-modal data makes integration and inference a non-trivial task. We developed a deep-learning-based framework, multi-omics variational autoencoders (MOVE), to integrate such data and applied it to a cohort of 789 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with deep multi-omics phenotyping from the DIRECT consortium. Using in silico perturbations, we identified drug-omics associations across the multi-modal datasets for the 20 most prevalent drugs given to people with type 2 diabetes with substantially higher sensitivity than univariate statistical tests. From these, we among others, identified novel associations between metformin and the gut microbiota as well as opposite molecular responses for the two statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin. We used the associations to quantify drug-drug similarities, assess the degree of polypharmacy and conclude that drug effects are distributed across the multi-omics modalities.","Here we show that it is possible to use unsupervised deep learning to integrate and extract associations from a deeply phenotyped cohort of people with T2D. While existing methods for vertical integration of multi-omics data focus on encoding the data to factors or latent representations that can be used for clustering and classification, we took this further by using the generative capacity of VAE models. In comparison to traditional univariate statistical tests, MOVE can identify significant drugÐomics associations for a wider selection of drugs. We believe that these improvements come from the ability of the generative models to infer multi-omics changes for individuals not receiving a drug thus increasing power. Previous work to stratify the newly diagnosed T2D individuals from this cohort used 32 clinical features to identify four archetypes representing different T2D subtypes7. In addition, they used metformin status of the individuals to investigate if the subgroups were confounded by metformin treatment and found no significant impact on the clusters and their multi-omics correlations. In contrast to their work, we added medication data on 19 additional drugs and used all data as input to our unsupervised deep-learning model allowing the model to learn from all inputs simultaneously. Thus, we were able to identify associations between the drugs and multi-omics data, including for metformin indicating the importance of vertical integration. The cross-sectional design and clinical data-guided medical decisions make it difficult to assess the directionality of drug associations and further complicates causal inference. Hence, it is not possible to draw causal conclusions on drug effects; however, the results can be considered as input to design informed studies as well as randomized clinical control studies. In the future, expansion with longitudinal multi-omics data and modeling time could add more information on the causality of the drugs by investigating the long-term effects and associations32. Similarly, our approach opens up for individualized analysis of patients in an N-of-1 approach61. It is well-known in health care that often selecting a drug or treatment in a situation at the same time excludes performing the control experiment of using another drug. Using MOVE, we can in principle ask what would happen if we gave the patient a drug and compare to the result of choosing another drug. Our cohort size is limited, but for larger cohorts of tens to hundreds of thousands of patients this could potentially be powerful to identify molecular associations and treatment outcomes for individual patients. Finally, we emphasize that our approach is, of course, not limited to drug associations; in principle, all the omics data could be assessed for associations across the datasets. We therefore believe that our generative method opens new possibilities in big multi-omics data analysis for discoveries of potential new biomarkers, carrying out gedankenexperiments, and investigating potential direct effects of drugs in high dimensionality molecular data that leads to testable hypotheses."
35848962,Machine Learning for Predicting the Risk of Transition from Prediabetes to Diabetes,"Traditional risk scores for the prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are typically designed for a general population and, thus, may underperform for people with prediabetes. In this study, we developed machine learning (ML) models predicting the risk of T2D that are specifically tailored to people with prediabetes. We analyzed data of 13,943 individuals with prediabetes, and built a ML model to predict the risk of transition from prediabetes to T2D, integrating information about demographics, biomarkers, medications, and comorbidities defined by disease codes. Additionally, we developed a simplified ML model with only eight predictors, which can be easily integrated into clinical practice. For a forecast horizon of 5 years, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.753 for our full ML model (79 predictors) and 0.752 for the simplified model. Our ML models allow for an early identification of people with prediabetes who are at risk of developing T2D.","We developed an ML model that predicts the risk for transition from prediabetes to T2D over forecast horizons of 1Ð5 years. Its AUROCs ranged from 0.753 to 0.780, thereby outperforming the logistic regression (P_<_0.05), the simplified logistic regression (P_<_0.05 except for a forecast horizon of 1 year where P_=_0.48), and the FDRSM (P_<_0.001), a well-established diabetes risk score that we have calibrated to our data. Prediction performance was largely robust, and, moreover, inter-year variability was small. We calculated SHAP values to identify the most important predictors of our ML model. The two most important predictors across all forecast horizons were glucose and HbA1c measurements. This can be expected, since these two measures are disease defining markers,14 which are known to be predictive.15 Age and BMI are well-known risk factors for T2D,1 and both were accordingly among the most important predictors in our ML model. The biomarkers triglyceride and serum creatinine were also identified as important predictors. The former has been already included in the FDRSM as a risk factor for T2D, and several studies indicate an increased diabetes risk for individuals with higher triglyceride levels.1,15 Previous studies have also shown that low serum creatinine levels are a risk factor for T2D.16,17 Further important predictors are discussed in Supplementary Data S10. ML models with a substantial number of predictors can be incorporated into clinical decision support systems, where data can be directly retrieved from EHRs. However, we are aware that a model with 84 predictors might be impractical in a clinical setting, where predictors must be manually inserted into a software. Furthermore, some of these predictors may not be broadly available or vary across health providers (e.g., disease codes). Hence, we developed a second, simplified ML model with only eight easily accessible predictors, namely age, BMI, glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, HDL, ALT, and serum creatinine measurements. These were also identified by the SHAP values as important predictors in the full ML model (e.g., age, glucose, HbA1c were among the most important predictors across all forecast horizons, HDL on the other hand only for a forecast horizon of 1 year). Despite the parsimonious structure, the simplified ML model still works well and outperforms the calibrated FDRSM (P_<_0.001). Thereby, it might provide a valuable alternative in clinical practice. Our ML models have several benefits. First, they were specifically designed for people with prediabetes. This is important as traditional risk scores and ML models are typically designed for a general population,1Ð6 for which the prediction performance may not generalize to individuals with prediabetes. Second, it is possible to model nonlinear relationships and interactions between predictors, thereby increasing the accuracy in identifying those at highest risk. Current guidelines recommend yearly diabetes screening for people with prediabetes.18 Our ML approach may allow for a more differentiated approach since it enables a personalized risk stratification over a 5-year horizon and thus may allow for an individualized screening procedure. Furthermore, by maximizing model specificity, resources could be specifically allocated to individuals at highest risk for the transition from prediabetes to diabetes. This would ease the burden on both the health care system and patients. Overall, a strength of our ML models is that they are specifically designed for people with prediabetes and that they include a larger number of predictors, which adds to an improved prediction performance. When we compare our ML models with those from Cahn et al,8 AUROCs do not differ substantially (0.779 [range over 10 seeds: (0.777Ð0.783)] for our simplified model vs. 0.782 [95% confidence interval: (0.778Ð0.788)] for the model from Cahn et al8 using only 1 year of historic patient data) on the 1-year forecast horizon. Unfortunately, Cahn et al8 do not provide the performance of their model using 1 year of historic patient data for forecast horizons larger than 1 year, making it impossible to directly compare our models with theirs on these forecast horizons. This study has limitations. First, it only covers an Israeli population, and, hence, its generalizability to other populations may be limited. However, our ML model could be extended to other populations in the future. Second, in this retrospective analysis, diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes was solely based on HbA1c measurements, ICD-9 codes, and prescribed antidiabetic medications, since we did not have information on time point of glucose sampling (i.e., fasting glucose). However, this can also be beneficial as it ensures direct applicability of our ML models to EHRs. Third, the missing time point of glucose sampling might limit its use as a predictor. However, the use of random glucose as a predictor also offers advantages, since random glucose is frequently measured in clinical practice, whereas assessment of fasting glucose is more cumbersome or not available. This makes our ML models more broadly applicable. Fourth, the comparison of our ML models to the FDRSM might be unfair since the latter was developed for a forecast horizon of 7 years. Even though we calibrated it to our data (i.e., people with prediabetes) and our forecast horizons, the predictors included in the FDRSM might have been specifically chosen for a forecast horizon of 7 years. However, the results of our robustness check, where we trained our ML models and the FDRSM on a forecast horizon of 7 years, revealed that our ML models are still significantly superior (AUROCs: 0.754 [full]/0.751 [simplified] vs. 0.708 [FDRSM]; P_<_0.001)."
35870573,Prediction of complications of type 2 Diabetes: A Machine learning approach,"Aim: To construct predictive models of diabetes complications (DCs) by big data machine learning, based on electronic medical records. Methods: Six groups of DCs were considered: eye complications, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy. A supervised, tree-based learning approach (XGBoost) was used to predict the onset of each complication within 5 years (task 1). Furthermore, a separate prediction for early (within 2 years) and late (3-5 years) onset of complication (task 2) was performed. A dataset of 147.664 patients seen during 15 years by 23 centers was used. External validation was performed in five additional centers. Models were evaluated by considering accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: For all DCs considered, the predictive models in task 1 showed an accuracy > 70 %, and AUC largely exceeded 0.80, reaching 0.97 for nephropathy. For task 2, all predictive models showed an accuracy > 70 % and an AUC > 0.85. Sensitivity in predicting the early occurrence of the complication ranged between 83.2 % (peripheral vascular disease) and 88.5 % (nephropathy). Conclusions: Machine learning approach offers the opportunity to identify patients at greater risk of complications. This can help overcoming clinical inertia and improving the quality of diabetes care.","Helping the clinicians to identify patients at high risk of developing diabetes complications in the short/medium term and inform treatment decisions can represent an important aid to overcome clinical inertia and improve the quality of diabetes care. In this study, we applied big data machine learning to construct new predictive models of different diabetes complications. Using data derived from electronic medical records, relative to 147.664 patients seen in 23 diabetes centers during 15 years, we developed models for the prediction of eye complications, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, and diabetic neuropathy. For all the complications considered, the predictive models showed very good accuracy and high sensitivity, reflected by AUC values over 0.85. Predictive models showed a particularly good performance in identifying the cases of early occurrence of the complications, making the models particularly attractive for their use in clinical practice, allowing the identification of individuals with more urgent need of attention. Furthermore, the models were built to predict the onset of complications among individuals for whom it was explicitly reported in EMRs they were free of that specific complication, thus avoiding misclassification. Of note, each of the variables investigated gave a little contribution in predicting the complications, supporting the concept that the simultaneous effect of multiple factors and their interaction play a role in determining the individual risk of developing end organ damage. Such a complex interaction cannot be captured by the clinician, and emphasizes the role of machine learning techniques in improving prediction and helping decision making. When the models were applied to patients from five additional diabetes centers, we found a variable level of predictive performance, ranging from acceptable to excellent. There was no obvious explanation for such a variability, which was not associated with the size of the population or the degree of missingness in the different features considered. It can be speculated that better performances of the predictive models could be obtained in those centers with more accurate registration of the data relative to presence or absence of the different complications. However, the models allowed in any case to identify a large number of patients at risk of complications, for whom it would be possible to improve diabetes care. Recently, machine learning approaches have been increasingly used to predict diabetes complications [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. However, the models developed frequently predict one single complication [22], [23], [27], [28], usually chronic kidney disease (CKD) [22], [23], [28]. In one study based on EMRs of 64,059 diabetes patients, the aggravation of CKD within six months was predicted using a model with 3073 features [23]. The model predicted CKD aggravation with 71 % accuracy. In another study, a temporal-enhanced gradient boosting machine model was applied for the prediction of CKD, using a broad spectrum of EMR data and thousands of features on a retrospective cohort of 14,039 adult patients with diabetes [22]. The model achieved an AUC of 0.83 (95 % CI 0.76Ð0.85), 0.78 (95 % CI 0.75Ð0.82), and 0.82 (95 % CI 0.78Ð0.86) in predicting CKD risk in years 2, 3, and 4 since diabetes mellitus onset, respectively. CKD prediction models have also been developed using the data of the ACCORD trial [28]. Data on 10,251 patients and 22 features have been used applying different machine learning approaches to predict early (within 2 years) and late (within 7 years) occurrence of CKD. AUC values > 0.70 were obtained in the different time windows. The prediction of development of nephropathy was among the complications considered in another study, along with retinopathy and neuropathy [25]. The study tested different machine learning approaches, with the best performance provided by logistic regression with rebalanced classes (AUC of 0.701, 0.734, and 0.721 for 3, 5 and 7 years prediction of nephropathy, respectively). However, the study population included only 943 patients and 7 features, and no external validation was performed. In our study, based on a very large population and a manageable number of features generally present in EMRs, the application of a XGBoost approach led to excellent predictive properties for the development of nephropathy in individuals with any diabetes duration, with an accuracy of 89.7 %, a sensitivity of 92.8 % and an AUC of 0.97. The external validation in five centers yielded AUC values ranging between 0.72 and 0.94. Machine learning approaches to predict other diabetes complications have been less frequently utilized. In a large study using administrative health data from the single-payer health system in Ontario, Canada, a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model was applied to predict three-year risk of adverse outcomes due to diabetes complications (hyper/hypoglycemia, tissue infection, retinopathy, cardiovascular events, amputation) [26]. The model was trained on data from 1,029,366 patients, validated on 272,864 patients, and tested on 265,406 patients. It included 700 features from multiple diverse data sources and showed an AUC of 0.795 for cardiovascular events. Another study used data from 8,756 patients free at baseline of heart failure (HF), with less than 10 % missing data, and enrolled in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, to predict incident HF [27]. Random survival forest (RSF) methods were applied, and the model was externally validated in a cohort of individuals with T2DM using the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). The RSF-based model for predicting incident HF at year 5, based on 22 features, showed an AUC of 0.77 and 0.74 in the ACCORD and ALLHAT cohorts, respectively. In our study, the prediction model for cardiovascular disease (including coronary heart disease and HF) showed an AUC of 0.817 in task 1 and 0.871 in task 2. In the five centers of the external validation, AUC ranged between 0.629 and 0.894 for task 1 and between 0.747 and 0.947 for task 2. A similar, strong discrimination was documented for the prediction of cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. As for retinopathy, while several studies have been conducted on the application of machine learning to retinal fundus images for automating screening and diagnosis [34], the prediction of development of eye complications has been seldom investigated. In the study previously described conducted in Canada by Ravaut et al [26], an AUC of 0.807 for the prediction of retinopathy was obtained. The study by Dagliati et al. previously mentioned [25, including 943 patients and 7 features, showed AUC of 0.808, 0.769, and 0.726 for 3, 5 and 7 years prediction of retinopathy, respectively. In our study, AUC of 0.857 and 0.861 was documented for task 1 and task 2, respectively. Finally, the same study [25] documented AUC of 0.799, 0.714, and 0.769 for 3, 5 and 7 years prediction of neuropathy, respectively. In our study, we obtained an AUC for the prediction of diabetic neuropathy of 0.840 for task 1 and 0.859 for task 2. The availability of prediction models that can be easily incorporated into EMRs can represent an important aid to the clinician for the identification of patients at higher risk of developing end-organ damage. Our models were based on information easily available and provided the prediction of all the major complications, thus allowing an overall assessment of the risk profile of the individual patient. The models also made the prediction in the short (2 years) and medium term (3Ð5 years), facilitating the identification of those patients who need immediate attention and more frequent follow-up visits, thus allowing a more rational use of healthcare resources. This process can have a great impact on clinical inertia and improve the quality of diabetes care. In particular, a mounting body of evidence supports the cardiovascular and renal benefits of new glucose-lowering drugs (SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP1 receptor agonists) [11], [12], [13], [14]. Similarly, the importance of controlling hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, body weight, and promoting smoking cessation in order to reduce end organ damage associated with diabetes is widely recognized [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. However, the desired therapeutic targets are not met in a large proportion of patients, and novel drugs are still largely underused, due to the persistence of clinical inertia [15], [16], [17]. The impact of the incorporation of the prediction models into EMRs will be evaluated in a large network of over 250 diabetes clinics participating in a continuous quality improvement initiative promoted by the Italian Association of Clinical Diabetologists (Associazione Medici Diabetologi - AMD) [17]. Our study has strengths and limitations. Among the strengths, it should be underlined the large size of the population, the manageable number of features making the models useful in different healthcare settings, the possibility to accurately predict all major complications, and the good performance of the models when externally validated in five different diabetes centers. Among the limitations, it should be mentioned that the prediction models have been developed to maximize sensitivity (true positive rate), with a possible penalty in terms of specificity (true negative rate). However, for all complications, with the only exception of cerebrovascular disease, specificity exceeded 70 %, indicating that the expected proportion of false-positive predictions is reasonable and, more important, unlikely to have negative consequences for the patients. As an additional limitation, the performance of the predictive models was not uniform in the five centers involved in the external validation, and we did not find an obvious explanation for such variability. However, the models allowed to identify a large number of patients at risk of complications, for whom it would be possible to improve diabetes care. In any case, clinicians using the predictive models should be warned against the false reassurance provided by a negative prediction (i.e. low risk of developing complications); from this point of view, artificial intelligence must be considered as an aid, and not a substitute, for clinical judgment. Preventing or delaying the onset of complications represents the primary goal of diabetes care. The growing availability of patient electronic medical records and the development of sophisticated algorithms that can learn from the data offer the unique opportunity to improve our ability to identify those patients at greater risk of complications and needing a closer monitoring or more appropriate interventions. The integration of machine learning models with clinical experience could represent the new frontier for the provision of care ever closer to the needs of the individual patient."
37957549,Optimizing diabetes classification with a machine learning-based framework,"Diabetes is a metabolic disorder usually caused by insufficient secretion of insulin from the pancreas or insensitivity of cells to insulin, resulting in long-term elevated blood sugar levels in patients. Patients usually present with frequent urination, thirst, and hunger. If left untreated, it can lead to various complications that can affect essential organs and even endanger life. Therefore, developing an intelligent diagnosis framework for diabetes is necessary. This paper proposes a machine learning-based diabetes classification framework machine learning optimized GAN. The framework encompasses several methodological approaches to address the diverse challenges encountered during the analysis. These approaches encompass the implementation of the mean and median joint filling method for handling missing values, the application of the cap method for outlier processing, and the utilization of SMOTEENN to mitigate sample imbalance. Additionally, the framework incorporates the employment of the proposed Diabetes Classification Model based on Generative Adversarial Network and employs logistic regression for detailed feature analysis. The effectiveness of the framework is evaluated using both the PIMA dataset and the diabetes dataset obtained from the GEO database. The experimental findings showcase our model achieved exceptional results, including a binary classification accuracy of 96.27%, tertiary classification accuracy of 99.31%, precision and f1 score of 0.9698, recall of 0.9698, and an AUC of 0.9702. The experimental results show that the framework proposed in this paper can accurately classify diabetes and provide new ideas for intelligent diagnosis of diabetes.","Diabetes, a condition lacking effective treatment, necessitates preventive measures to halt its progression. In this regard, we propose a machine learning-based framework, MOG, for accurate and reliable diabetes diagnosis. The framework integrates essential components, including data preprocessing, SMOTEENN, and classification model development, to achieve precise diagnostic outcomes. To enhance the integrity and quality of the dataset, comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, encompassing missing value imputation and outlier handling using the capping method, are employed. Additionally, by relabeling the PIMA dataset based on glucose levels, effective categorization into three distinct classesÑdiabetes, prediabetes, and non-diabetesÑis achieved. This classification scheme offers valuable insights into the dynamics of disease progression. Furthermore, the imbalance in the PIMA dataset is addressed using the SMOTEENN technique. The primary contribution of this study lies in the development of the DCSGAN model, which leverages adversarial neural networks for classification tasks. The model exhibits exceptional performance, achieving impressive accuracy rates of 96.27% and 99.31% for dichotomous and trichotomous tasks, respectively. Furthermore, the DCSGAN model demonstrates its ability to generalize well across diverse scenarios by surpassing other models across all 12 datasets in the GEO dataset. Additionally, a logistic regression-based correlation analysis reveals significant biomarkers, including Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI, and Diabetes Pedigree Function, which play a crucial role in diabetes diagnosis. These findings shed light on the factors influencing accurate identification of diabetes cases. For future research directions, several avenues can be explored. Firstly, the integration of additional biomarkers and clinical variables can be investigated to enhance the accuracy and reliability of diabetes diagnosis. Secondly, extending the MOG framework to encompass longitudinal data analysis and predictive modeling can enable proactive management of diabetes by capturing disease progression patterns over time. Lastly, comprehensive validation and optimization of the proposed framework through extensive clinical trials will ensure its applicability and effectiveness in real-world healthcare settings."
29054258,Comparative approaches for classification of diabetes mellitus data: Machine learning paradigm,"Diabetes is a silent killer. The main cause of this disease is the presence of excessive amounts of metabolites such as glucose. There were about 387 million diabetic people all over the world in 2014. The financial burden of this disease has been calculated to be about $13,700 per year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these figures will more than double by the year 2030. This cost will be reduced dramatically if someone can predict diabetes statistically on the basis of some covariates. Although several classification techniques are available, it is very difficult to classify diabetes. The main objectives of this paper are as follows: (i) Gaussian process classification (GPC), (ii) comparative classifier for diabetes data classification, (iii) data analysis using the cross-validation approach, (iv) interpretation of the data analysis and (v) benchmarking our method against others. To classify diabetes, several classification techniques are used such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and Naive Bayes (NB). However, most of the medical data show non-normality, non-linearity and inherent correlation structure. So in this paper we adapted Gaussian process (GP)-based classification technique using three kernels namely: linear, polynomial and radial basis kernel. We also investigate the performance of a GP-based classification technique in comparison to existing techniques such as LDA, QDA and NB. Performances are evaluated by using the accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Pima Indian diabetes dataset is taken as part of the study. This consists of 768 patients, of which 268 patients are diabetic and 500 patients are controls. Our machine learning system shows the performance of GP-based model as: ACC 81.97%, SE 91.79%, SP 63.33%, PPV 84.91% and NPV 62.50% which are larger compared to other methods.","In the last decade GP has become a powerful, non-parametric tool that is used mainly in regression and also in classification problems in order to handle various problems such as linearity of classical methods, complex data types, curse of dimension etc. GPC is an attractive tool for prediction problems. The prediction of GPC for binary class problem is very simple. It is a generalization of linear logistic regression, where the logistic function is used as activation function. In this paper we use three types of kernel function, linear, polynomial and radial basis kernel function. However, any positive definite function can be used as the kernel function. So, we should choose kernel on the basis of ongoing research goal. We can also simply choose kernel functions assuming prior information by knowing the properties of the kernel functions. For binary class problem we use sigmoid activation function. GPC is noise-free, and can be combined it with smooth activation functions, such as the logistic function. However, the likelihood function calculation for GPC using logistic activation function is intractable. Therefore, approximations algorithms must be needed, like the Laplace approximation or the Expectation Propagation (EP). In this study we have used the Laplace approximation for binary class problem of GPC. The focus of our study covered the following components: Comprehensive analysis between the three types of kernels for GPC-based paradigm using Laplace approximation framework for classification of diabetic (268) vs. control (500) in a 768 patient database, and further, comparing our 3 kernel-based GPC-classification against three other types of classifiers: LDA, QDA and NB, respectively. This thread leads to benchmarking our GPC system against three sets of other classifiers. Finally, performance evaluation of the machine learning system using the parameters such as: ACC, SE, SP, PPV, NPV, and ROC. Even though, the numbers of classifiers adapted in our study were only four, but theoretical benchmarking was accomplished against ten articles published in the literature Table 3 and [39], [40], [41]. The results are encouraging when compared against the four set of classifiers. An exhaustive research needs to be conducted to benchmark large data size and more number of classification techniques. In this paper we have investigated the performance of three conventional classification techniques along with most recent technique, Gaussian process classification to classify diabetes status. Here, we divide the dataset into K5 and K10 folds and we have found the optimum results for K10 fold. In this case the accuracy for GPC with radial, linear and polynomial kernels are: 81.97%, 78.03% and 77.20%, respectively. GPC with radial basis kernel gives higher accuracy. Therefore, radial basis kernel function is selected for GP model. GPC with radial basis kernel gives ACC of 81.97%, SE of 91.79%, SP of 63.33%, PPV of 80.88% and NPV of 67.86% for the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and these values are larger compared to other three classification techniques LDA, QDA and NB. The strength of Gaussian process framework is that it is a sophisticated classifier with computational tractability. GP can fit a wide variety of nonlinear and linear functions easily. It can also handle uncertainty in unknown functions by averaging. It can learn kernel parameters automatically from the data set. It provides full probabilistic prediction, whereas, SVM does not give any probability measure directly. One of the main difficulties of Gaussian process model is to choose a kernel which can represent the correct structure of the data. GP model may be extended or generalized by solving the above problems as well as difficulties."
35940302,Predicting misdiagnosed adult-onset type 1 diabetes using machine learning,"Aims: It is now understood that almost half of newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes are adult-onset. However, type 1 and type 2 diabetes are difficult to initially distinguish clinically in adults, potentially leading to ineffective care. In this study a machine learning model was developed to identify type 1 diabetes patients misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this retrospective study, a machine learning model was developed to identify misdiagnosed type 1 diabetes patients from a population of patients with a prior type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Using Ambulatory Electronic Medical Records (AEMR), features capturing relevant information on age, demographics, risk factors, symptoms, treatments, procedures, vitals, or lab results were extracted from patients' medical history. Results: The model identified age, BMI/weight, therapy history, and HbA1c/blood glucose values among top predictors of misdiagnosis. Model precision at low levels of recall (10 %) was 17 %, compared to <1 % incidence rate of misdiagnosis at the time of the first type 2 diabetes encounter in AEMR. Conclusions: This algorithm shows potential for being translated into screening guidelines or a clinical decision support tool embedded directly in an EMR system to reduce misdiagnosis of adult-onset type 1 diabetes and implement effective care at the outset.","One of the key challenges in the care of patients with adult-onset of type 1 diabetes is the considerable rate at which these patients are misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes potentially leading to ineffective care. In our cohorts this rate was ~10 %, however; we aimed to define cohorts very conservatively in accordance with ML modeling best practices and therefore ~10 % could be considered a lower bound of the actual rate of misdiagnosis. Several machine learning algorithms developed for the detection of undiagnosed or misdiagnosed patients have shown considerable potential to improve patient outcomes through accelerating time to correct diagnosis and treatment [21,22]. While the power of computational machine learning and AI-based technologies are yet to be exploited in the accurate diagnosis or epidemiology of adult-onset type 1 diabetes Ð and hence the value of this current research as a stepping stone in the field Ð there have been some instances where logistic regression and machine learning have been used to set diagnostic criteria for diabetes and differentiation between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes [23Ð26]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted on identification of patients with adult-onset type 1 diabetes who are misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes using AI algorithms on healthcare data. In this retrospective, case-control cohort study based on US data, a machine learning model was developed to identify misdiagnosed type 1 diabetes patients among patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Studying the top model features and their impact on the decision making of the model provided clinical insights into risk factors of a patient about to be diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes indeed being a type 1 diabetes patient with adult-onset. Furthermore, this study represents an important step of robust analytical and clinical retrospective validation of the ML algorithm as a part of the lifecycle of clinical decision support development. As the next step, the study team is planning to prospectively validate the ML algorithm in an interventional setting at the point of care to gather valuable insight into real-world performance, generalizability, clinical workflow integration, and user adoption, among others. These learnings will inform key considerations around efficient deployment into clinical care at scale. From the results of this algorithm, a patient with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is more likely to be a true type 1 diabetes patient, i.e., misdiagnosed with type 2, if they are younger, have lower weight and BMI, and have fewer and less recent encounters for hypertension. In addition, if a patient has higher HbA1c and blood glucose levels, and a higher number of insulin refills, they are more likely to be a true type 1 diabetes patient. A clinical implication of these results is that if a patient is demonstrating poor treatment outcomes, closer evaluation is required before classifying their type of diabetes. Furthermore, patients with more interactions with specialists (such as endocrinologists) than general practitioners are more likely to be true type 1 diabetes patients, potentially implying that patients whose diabetes is managed in the primary care setting are more likely to remain misdiagnosed. This would further suggest that deploying this type of algorithm in a primary care setting is likely to lead to more impactful improvement in the diagnosis. While these observations are helpful in validating the model from a clinical standpoint and driving clinical insights, turning them into simple rules for diagnosis and clinical care might not be straightforward. An ML algorithm such as the one utilized in this study can look for complex, and sometimes subtle, associations of these, and hundreds of other features in the medical history of the patients, to effectively find misdiagnosed patients. This algorithm can then be further developed into a clinical decision support tool accessible to providers at the point of care or screening questionnaire accessible to patients and broader population, that would automatically screen type 2 diabetes patients to find those at risk of misdiagnosis. Understanding the end deployment of the model as a screening tool and its various considerations, influences the methodology applied when developing the model. One such variation of deployment is the points of interest throughout a patientÕs journey when the algorithm would be applied. If the model is to be deployed as a clinical decision support tool to screen patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and identify potentially misdiagnosed type 1 patients at this earlier point of their patient journey, this would drive methodological decision to develop a model indexed at the initial type 2 diagnosis (this study). Conversely, if the model is to be applied at any point in a patientÕs journey with a diabetes encounter, the developed model would have to be indexed at any encounter for diabetes diagnosis for the patient. Another consideration in deployment of ML algorithms is the complexity vs precision. While in most cases the higher the number of predictors the model has at its disposal, the better it can predict the outcome of interest, there are instances where a less complex set of predictors is desirable, even at the expense of some loss in precision. For example, significantly reducing the number of predictors used by the model can create an opportunity for converting a complex ML algorithm into a simple screening questionnaire. While the findings in this study point to significant benefits of the developed algorithm in predicting misdiagnosis of type 1 diabetes, there are some limitations to this study. First, is this studyÕs inevitable dependance on available medical records as a proxy for health information. Clinical coding in AEMR relies on manual entry at the point of care. Relying on these codes to infer information about the patients and their care (e.g., having a record of type 2 diabetes diagnosis being indicative of a patient indeed receiving a type 2 diabetes diagnosis) is prone to some level of error. Missing data is another challenge in AEMR due to lack of collection (not requested by the clinician), lack of documentation (not documented by the clinician) or limited coverage of the patient within AEMR (patients moving in and out of different health systems). Similarly, prescription activity captured in AEMR data only reflects in-office orders and administration of medications by physicians, with the final fill status of these prescription orders not captured. Furthermore, due to non-standardized way that visit information is stored, some visit information (such as test data) may be recorded in other formats or fields not captured in the study. Gaps in the data may result in potentially missing events that occurred in the patientÕs medical history. While the XGBoost algorithm is powerful in dealing with missing data without a need for imputation, missing data deprives the algorithm from potentially valuable information about the patient, and thus might impact model performance. In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the challenge of diagnosis and care of adult-onset type 1 diabetes due to the complexity of risk factors involved. The machine learning algorithm developed in this study shows potential for future development into screening guidelines or a clinical decision support tool embedded directly in an AEMR system to reduce misdiagnosis of adult-onset of type 1 diabetes and implement effective care at the outset."
36360783,"Decoding Diabetes Biomarkers and Related Molecular Mechanisms by Using Machine Learning, Text Mining, and Gene Expression Analysis","The molecular basis of diabetes mellitus is yet to be fully elucidated. We aimed to identify the most frequently reported and differential expressed genes (DEGs) in diabetes by using bioinformatics approaches. Text mining was used to screen 40,225 article abstracts from diabetes literature. These studies highlighted 5939 diabetes-related genes spread across 22 human chromosomes, with 112 genes mentioned in more than 50 studies. Among these genes,ÊHNF4A,ÊPPARA,ÊVEGFA,ÊTCF7L2,ÊHLA-DRB1,ÊPPARG,ÊNOS3,ÊKCNJ11,ÊPRKAA2, andÊHNF1AÊwere mentioned in more than 200 articles. These genes are correlated with the regulation of glycogen and polysaccharide, adipogenesis, AGE/RAGE, and macrophage differentiation. Three datasets (44 patients and 57 controls) were subjected to gene expression analysis. The analysis revealed 135 significant DEGs, of whichÊCEACAM6,ÊENPP4,ÊHDAC5,ÊHPCAL1,ÊPARVG,ÊSTYXL1,ÊVPS28,ÊZBTB33,ÊZFP37ÊandÊCCDC58Êwere the top 10 DEGs. These genes were enriched in aerobic respiration, T-cell antigen receptor pathway, tricarboxylic acid metabolic process, vitamin D receptor pathway, toll-like receptor signaling, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response. The results of text mining and gene expression analyses used as attribute values for machine learning (ML) analysis. The decision tree, extra-tree regressor and random forest algorithms were used in ML analysis to identify unique markers that could be used as diabetes diagnosis tools. These algorithms produced prediction models with accuracy ranges from 0.6364 to 0.88 and overall confidence interval (CI) of 95%. There were 39 biomarkers that could distinguish diabetic and non-diabetic patients, 12 of which were repeated multiple times. The majority of these genes are associated with stress response, signalling regulation, locomotion, cell motility, growth, and muscle adaptation. Machine learning algorithms highlighted the use of theÊHLA-DQB1Êgene as a biomarker for diabetes early detection. Our data mining and gene expression analysis have provided useful information about potential biomarkers in diabetes.","In this study, a systematic methodology was followed to investigate the most common diabetes-related genes. We used three different techniques, including gene expression analysis, text-mining, and ML. Each of these techniques was useful in revealing important aspects of diabetes pathogenicity as well as important markers for early disease diagnosis. Based on text mining, most of the highly common diabetes-related genes in the literature were correlated with glucagon and AMPK signaling pathways such as HNF4A, PCK2, and SIRT1, which were among the most interactive genes in the PPI analysis. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) is a highly conserved transcription factor expressed in pancreatic beta cells and required by islet beta and liver cells to maintain glucose hemostasis [31]. HNF4A crucially performs hepatic gluconeogenesis regulation and insulin secretion, and the corresponding gene was shown to be linked to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in several studies [32]. Its loss-of-function mutations have been linked to young-onset diabetes and lipid disorders, and some mutations have been identified in several populations as risk loci for T2DM [33]. Additionally, some studies have assessed the impact of HNF4A gene variations on preventing and treating coronary artery disease complications. HNF4A gene variants may modify and modulate hepatic lipase and lipid metabolism, resulting in a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis progression and event occurrence [34]. Diabetes and coronary artery disease share many genetic key elements, owing to the fact that diabetes is considered to predispose to diabetic cardiomyopathy and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [35]. PCK1 and PCK2 have been proposed as potential diabetes and obesity-associated genes [36]. PCK1 and PCK2 are phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK or PEPCK) gene isoforms that are found in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. PEPCK is a cataplerotic enzyme which removes citric acid cycle anions for either the biosynthetic process or the subsequent complete oxidation of these substances to carbon dioxide inside the citric acid cycle [37]. PCK plays an important role in cell homeostasis and in cell development, including physiological processes such as glucose metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) [38]. Because insulin suppresses the expression of these enzymes, it has long been assumed that patients with T2D have increased expression of PCK due to hepatic insulin resistance [39,40]. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) was the first member of the silent information regulator 2 (SIR2) family to be discovered, and it catalyzes the deacetylation of both histone and non-histone lysine residues [41]. SIRT1 exerts its anti-oxidative effects by activating NRF2, a transcription factor that binds to antioxidant-responsive element genes associated with the scavenging of oxygen free radicals [42]. Recent research has shown that Sirt1 protein expression and downstream signaling were downregulated in diabetes [43]. The enrichment analysis of these genes highlighted the role of several biological pathways such as macrophage differentiation, FoxO, and adipogenesis. FoxO proteins play a significant role in mediating the impact of insulin on metabolism, including their effects on hepatic glucose production [44]. Gene expression analysis revealed a consistent differential expression between healthy and diabetic individuals in a specific set of genes. Such findings support the fact that diabetes is a multi-locus disorder with many genes controlling its pathogenesis [45]. Several genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed across diabetes gene profiles in our analysis. Most genes have been related to diabetes and cancer, with most of them being linked to pancreatic cancer (CEACAM6, HDAC5, HPCAL1, PARVG, and STYXL1). CEA cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) is a key gene for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CEACAM6 is a cancer biomarker that regulates anoikis resistance as well as the metastatic process of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells [46]. Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), a key mediator of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, was identified as a major component of the fasting glucagon signalling pathway and is reported to be increased in the kidneys of diabetic patients and animals [47,48]. T2DM can cause hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) dysfunction, which is accompanied by increased circulating/hypothalamic HDAC5. Some findings suggest that acetate restores HPO function in T2DM by suppressing HDAC5 and increasing insulin sensitivity [49]. Furthermore, HDAC5 is involved as a common pathogenic factor in both type 1 and type 2 in vivo animal models of diabetes [49]. STYXL1 is one of three known STYX pseudophosphatases, a group of genes for which research is currently being conducted to better understand their role in disease [50]. A correlation analysis of the important genes linked to diabetes revealed a cluster of highly active genes (Figure 8). The genes with many correlated links to other diabetes-related genes included NCK1, HIGD1A, VRK3, KBTBD8, ZBTB33, TMTC4, MRPS28, DYNLT3, and SMARCAD1 (Figure 8). Most of these genes are a part of the biological regulatory system [51,52]. Furthermore, some of these genes, such as NCK1, play an important role in diabetes by modifying PERK activation and signalling. NCK1 deficiency increases pancreatic cell survival in response to diabetes-related stresses [53]. Additionally, the PPI analysis showed several highly interactive genes including nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, such as MDH1, and NDUFB5. Malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) produces the human cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. This latter is vital in transporting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) equivalents through the mitochondrial membrane, and therefore controlling TCA cycle, which is highly linked to diabetes pathogenesis [54]. The gene-enrichment analysis of the diabetes-associated expressed genes revealed that a significant number of these genes were correlated with T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) pathway, vitamin D receptor pathway, toll-like receptor signaling, and ER unfolded protein response. The association of TCR and diabetes development has been reported in several studies, where the use of anti-TCR has been studied in the therapeutic strategy for diabetes [55]. Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and receptors for the active form of the vitamin have been found in both beta and immune cells. Protein-folding stress in the ER is a prominent feature of specialised secretory cells and has been linked to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. The comparison of diabetes gene lists derived from text mining and gene expression analysis revealed some shared genomic aspects at different levels (Figure 9). It demonstrated that text-mining genes have a more biological interaction than gene expression analysis genes (Figure 9A). The biological relationship between the two lists may suggest the significance of both lists in presenting the variable genes involved in diabetes. We should broaden our scope to include more genes that may be important in understanding the disease structure. The two genes shared between text-mining and gene expression analyses are TIMP1 and POMC (Figure 9B). TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a class of peptidases involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix. TIMP1 levels were significantly higher in the serum of T2DM patients, and raises the possibility that it plays a role in T2DM bone fragility [56]. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) encodes a preproprotein that undergoes tissue-specific post-translational processes. Increases in food consumption and body weight can result from POMC mutations. White adipose tissue undergoes a phenotypic switch in response to weight gain and obesity, which causes it to release proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the emergence of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [57]. The significance of specific loci, including those on chromosome X, was brought to light by examining the genomic locations of genes derived from the two methods. Previous reports have emphasised the connection between the pathogenesis of diabetes and genes on chromosome X [58,59]. There were several of these genes, including TIMP1, FOXP3, GATA1, OTUD5, and PRAF2 (Figure 9C). Some of these genes are known to be correlated with sex and age, such as TIMP1 [60], and FOXP3 [61]. The two methods shared many expected KEGG terms, biological pathways, and gene ontology terms, including citrate cycle [62], leukocyte migration [63] and other pathways with a known association with diabetes. We chose the expression of a few specific genes in the datasets under study by using text mining, and we used well-known machine learning techniques on the selected data to find biomarkers that distinguish between the two disease states. A significant proportion of the potential biomarkers were linked to HLA-DQB1 Table 2 and Figure 10. The HLA-DQB1 gene belongs to a group of genes known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. This group of genes is a major component of familial clustering in both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, where subjects carrying specific mutations in this group are at a high risk of developing T1D [64]. Recently, the tenth article highlights the importance of HLA-DQB1 in diabetes and suggests its function in this disease [65,66,67]. Furthermore, machine learning highlighted the significance of biomarkers associated with (SLC25A46), (IKBKB), and (IRF5) Table 2. SLC25A46 is a mitochondrial carrier protein that is found in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is the closest human homolog to a yeast protein involved in mitochondrial fusion [68]. The detailed function of SLC25A46 is still unknown, and it may facilitate transport across the mitochondrial membrane or act as a molecular adaptor protein [69]. SLC25A46 loss can cause neurodegeneration in mice by affecting mitochondrial dynamics and energy production [70]. Several studies have recently suggested a link between it and diabetes phenotypes in mice and humans [71,72]. Both IKBKB and IRF5 function in immune response, apoptosis, and toll-like receptor signalling pathways. In type 2 diabetes and obesity, IRFs play a crucial role as metabolic transcriptional regulators. The polarisation of macrophages toward the inflammatory M1-phenotype has been associated with IRF5. In line with the inflammatory signatures, the increased IRF5 expression in the adipose tissue of diabetic obese patients has been suggested as a potential marker for metabolic inflammation in obesity/T2D [73]. IKBKB is a crucial upstream modulator of the NF-kB pathway and a pro-inflammatory response regulator. When it is inhibited, lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines are reduced [74]. IKBKB was discovered to play a role in the development of T2DM, and studies have shown that its deletion inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines that increase insulin resistance [75,76]. These findings suggest that the machine learning analysis was essential for broadening viewpoints, enabling the observation of some hidden figures in genes related to diabetes, and aiding in the improvement of text-mining and gene expression analysis results."
36482994,Machine learning-based metabolism-related genes signature and immune infiltration landscape in diabetic nephropathy,"Background: To identify the diagnostic biomarkers of metabolism-related genes (MRGs), and investigate the association of the MRGs and immune infiltration landscape in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Methods: The transcriptome matrix was downloaded from the GEO database. R package ""limma"" was utilized to identify the differential expressed MRGs (DE-MRGs) of HC and DN samples. Genetic Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of DE-MRGs were performed using ""clusterProfiler"" R package. WGCNA, LASSO, SVM-RFE, and RFE algorithms were employed to select the diagnostic feature biomarkers for DN. The ROC curve was used to evaluate discriminatory ability for diagnostic feature biomarkers. CIBERSORT algorithm was performed to investigate the fraction of the 22-types immune cells in HC and DN group. The correlation of diagnostic feature biomarkers and immune cells were performed via Spearman-rank correlation algorithm. Results: A total of 449 DE-MRGs were identified in this study. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the DE-MRGs were mainly enriched in small molecules catabolic process, purine metabolism, and carbon metabolism. ADI1, PTGS2, DGKH, and POLR2B were identified as diagnostic feature biomarkers for DN via WGCNA, LASSO, SVM-RFE, and RFE algorithms. The result of CIBERSORT algorithm illustrated a remarkable difference of immune cells in HC and DN group, and the diagnostic feature biomarkers were closely associated with immune cells. Conclusion: ADI1, PTGS2, DGKH, and POLR2B were identified as diagnostic feature biomarkers for DN, and associated with the immune infiltration landscape, providing a novel perspective for the future research and clinical management for DN.","The involvement of metabolic diseases in the development of DN has attracted increasing attention. In this study, we used a variety of bioinformatics algorithms to study the role of MRGs in the pathogenesis of DN. Four MRGs were identified as diagnostic characteristic biomarkers of DN, indicating the importance role of MRGs in the DN process. We observed significantly reduced ADI1 mRNA expression levels in DN patients. As one of the four genes associated with prognosis, ADI1 has not been reported in DN. As a metabolism-related gene, ADI1 has been reported to be associated with the production of methionine metabolites S-adenosine methionine (SAM) and methionine sulfoxide (14). Higher plasma levels of methionine metabolites, including SAM, have been reported in diabetic nephropathy patients than in diabetic patients without nephropathy, and are associated with higher morbidity and mortality in diabetic nephropathy patients (15Ð17). In addition, the depletion of ADI1 can be caused by iron depletion (18). Whereas iron deficiency has been shown to be beneficial for coronary response, endothelial dysfunction, insulin secretion, insulin action, and metabolic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (19). In contrast, ferroptosis caused by iron overload leads to tubular cell death in diabetic nephropathy (20, 21). However, this does not explain the reduced rather than increased ADI1 expression levels we found in DN patients. Our further data showed that ADI1 expression level was positively correlated with M2 macrophages and neutrophils, and negatively correlated with B cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8+T cells, suggesting that ADI1 was associated with inhibitory immunophenotype. Combined with the reduction in ADI1 expression levels found above in DN patients, our data support the existence of reduced ADI1 levels and increased immune system activation levels in DN patients. The involvement of the immune system as one of the important pathogenic causes of DN partially confirmed the significance of reduced ADI1 level in DN patients. DGKH diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) is a member of the enzyme family. Members of this family are involved in regulating the intracellular concentrations of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. Studies on DGKH mainly focus on bipolar disorder, unipolar depression and adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), etc. (22, 23). These results show that DGKH plays an important role in brain lipid metabolism. In addition, DGKH is associated with the formation of kidney stones by affecting calcium sensitive receptor (CasR) signaling and calcium metabolism in the body (24). Although there is no relevant study on DGKH in DN, it has been reported that there is a highly significant correlation between glomerular filtration rate, inflammation and lipid metabolism genes, supporting the possible role of abnormal lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of DN (9). The role of DGKH in DN needs to be further confirmed. As the second largest subunit encoding RNA polymerase II (Pol II), POLR2B catalyzes the transcription of DNA into mRNA, snRNA and microRNA precursors. This subunit and the largest subunit form opposite sides of the Pol II central cleft. Its alternative splicing results in multiple transcriptional variants (25). POLR2B has been reported to be associated with macular degeneration at home and abroad (26, 27). Because macular degeneration is closely related to diabetes, POLR2B may be involved in the process of diabetes. In addition, POLR2B is involved in the regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic subunit (PRKDC) and RNA polymerase II. The recruitment of Pol II to HBV Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) assists in the phosphorylation of Pol II at Ser5 and Ser2, thereby promoting HBV transcription (28). Chronic hepatitis B virus infection as an independent predictor of renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (29) also suggests an important role for POLR2B in DN. Compared with POLR2B, PTGS2 is convincingly involved in the development of DN. Immune dysfunction is one of the important factors of progressive nephropathy. It is traditionally believed that PTGS2, as an important mediator of inflammatory injury in diseases, produces prostaglandins (PGs) that are related to pathologic renal hemodynamics in diabetes and mediate renal injury caused by hemodynamic changes. (30, 31). However, recent reports suggest that the role of PTGS2 in the development of DN and other renal injuries is complex. The expression of PTGS2 in macrophages prevents the development of diabetic nephropathy (32). Meanwhile, specific knockdown of PTGS2 in podocytes exacerbates diabetic nephropathy (33). This is consistent with our observation of lower M2 macrophage expression levels and lower PTGS2 mRNA expression levels in DN. Our results support the idea that the role of PTGS2 in renal injury may depend on the source of PTGS2, the mechanism of renal injury, and the expression and subtype of PGE 2 receptors (32). Further data showed PTGS2 expression level was positively correlated with expressions of M2 macrophages, NK cells and gamma delta T cells. Meanwhile, it was negatively correlated with B cell, CD4 T cell, and CD8+ T cell expressions. Similar to ADI1, the above results also suggest that PTGS2 is associated with a suppressive immunophenotype. Combined with the decreased PTGS2 expression level we found in the above-mentioned DN patients; it is partially confirmed that the decreased PTGS2 levels in DN patients may be related to the enhanced activation of the immune system. The correlation between immune cells and diagnostic biomarkers was preliminarily discussed. We observed lower M2 macrophage levels in DN patients as a result of immune infiltration. In contrast to the pro-inflammatory and pro-DN effects of M1 (34), polarization of renal M1 macrophages to M2 phenotype can ameliorate experimental diabetic kidney injury by inhibiting renal M1 macrophages (34, 35). This is associated with a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, extracellular matrix/profibrotic proteins, and improved renal function and histology (36). In addition, PGE 2 production by PTGS2 is important for macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype (37). Above, we observed that lower PTGS2 in DN may also be involved in the regulation of immune infiltration. In view of the important ameliorative effect of Pentraxin-3 and other drugs on the polarization of macrophages into M2 phenotype in DN, focusing on macrophage phenotype may play a more important role in DN treatment in the future (35). In conclusion, the present study employed a variety of bioinformatic algorithms to investigate the role of MRGs in the pathogenesis of DN, and identified 4 MRGs as diagnostic biomarkers for DN. In addition, the correlation of immune cells with diagnostic biomarkers was initially discussed. By combining studies on the relationship between metabolism and immune microenvironment, this study provides new perspectives and insights for the future treatment of DN patients."
31098679,Towards more Accessible Precision Medicine: Building a more Transferable Machine Learning Model to Support Prognostic Decisions for Micro- and Macrovascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Although machine learning models are increasingly being developed for clinical decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes, the adoption of these models into clinical practice remains limited. Currently, machine learning (ML) models are being constructed on local healthcare systems and are validated internally with no expectation that they would validate externally and thus, are rarely transferrable to a different healthcare system. In this work, we aim to demonstrate that (1) even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, (2) while a model constructed on a local healthcare system's cohort is difficult to transfer; (3) we examine the impact of training cohort size on the transferability; and (4) we discuss criteria for external validity. We built a model using our previously published Multi-Task Learning-based methodology on a national cohort extracted from OptumLabs¨ Data Warehouse and transferred the model to two local healthcare systems (i.e., University of Minnesota Medical Center and Mayo Clinic) for external evaluation. The model remained valid when applied to the local patient populations and performed as well as locally constructed models (concordance: .73-.92), demonstrating transferability. The performance of the locally constructed models reduced substantially when applied to each other's healthcare system (concordance: .62-.90). We believe that our modeling approach, in which a model is learned from a national cohort and is externally validated, produces a transferable model, allowing patients at smaller healthcare systems to benefit from precision medicine.","Although machine learning models are increasingly being developed for clinical decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes, the adoption of these models into clinical practice remains limited.

We believe that our modeling approach, in which a model is learned from a national cohort and is externally validated, produces a transferable model, allowing patients at smaller healthcare systems to benefit from precision medicine. The concept of external validity is more complicated than it seems to be [35, 36]. Especially, in order to judge external validity, it is important to define a target population on which external validity is dependent, but the definition is often omitted in most studies, limiting the transferability of a model. Additionally, the criteria for external validity is undefined. Performance is a predominant criterion for external validity in the vast majority of literature [37, 38]; however, external validity could, in theory, include clinical findings (e.g., prognostic factors). Going beyond risk prediction, in order for ML models to be useful for patientsÕ prognosis or treatment development, the use of a compound criterion including predictive performance and clinical findings will become increasingly important. Lastly, institutional policies pose great challenges to external validation because they can influence the available variables for study. For example, health disparities are highly predictive of T2DM and its complications [39,40,41] but are not commonly collected in routine practice. Models using such variables will eventually be impractical in many other healthcare systems. Therefore, it is crucial to use a set of variables that are commonly observable and able to explain the outcome variable sufficiently so that the model achieves reasonable predictive power. One may argue that as long as a model is only applied to its training population (a model is never transferred to a different healthcare system), internal validity is sufficient. This is not necessarily true. As previously mentioned, a model can encounter patients atypical for its training population. Also, institutional policies vary among healthcare systems and could change at anytime. Most models for clinical applications are based on patient characteristics and disease characteristics, but we must be aware that policies can influence outcomes in a way that is not determined by these characteristics [35]. Consequently, models implicitly incorporate the effects of the policies into the effects of physiological factors. Thus, external validation is helpful at least to detect the presence of institutional policies. We found that a larger sample size led to increased transferability, however, transferability reached a steady state at a sample size of 30 K. While this sample size was the same for all three modeling algorithms we tried, it is possible that other models, such as deep learning, would saturate at a different sample size. We found that variantOL.A1c.2247 performed worse than variantMCR, indicating a lack of representativeness. A representative training set should be an unbiased reflection of a population such that predictions of a model should not be dependable but consistent across various subpopulations. With a sample size of 2247, variantOL.A1c.2247 was not able to learn enough detail about the national OLDW cohort, therefore it performed inadequately on patients in the local healthcare system. More importantly, variantOL.FPG.8091 built on the national OLDW training set outperformed variantUMMC in external validation even when the sample size and the set of variables are kept identical, which demonstrates a national training set yields a more transferable ML model. Although many patients were excluded due to missing lab results and vital signs measurements, we did not impute them. Diabetic patients are supposed to receive routine check-ups and see their primary care physicians regularly. For patients without any HbA1c or blood pressure measurements at all during the baseline period, it was uncertain whether we could establish their baseline characteristics correctly."
35751828,Machine learning algorithm to evaluate risk factors of diabetic foot ulcers and its severity,"Early identification of the risk factors associated with development of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) can be facilitated using machine learning techniques. The aim of this study is to find out the association of various clinical and biochemical risk factors with DFU and develop a prediction model using different machine learning algorithms. Eighty each of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with DFU and (T2DM) without DFU were enrolled for this observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were analysed using different machine learning algorithms: Support vector machines (SVM-Poly K), Naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), random forest (RF) and three ensemble learners: Stacking C, Bagging and AdaBoost for constructing prediction models for discriminating between the two groups (stage I classification) and ulcer type classification (stage II classification). Ensemble learning performed better than individual classifiers in terms of various performance evaluation metrics. New risk factors like ApoA1 and IL-10 for development of DFU in diabetes mellitus were identified. IL-10 along with uric acid could discriminate the grades of ulcers according to its severity. Decision fusion strategy using Stacking C algorithm resulted in enhanced prediction accuracy for both the stages of classification which can be used as a complementary method for computational screening for DFU and its subtypes. Current methodology for T2DM with DFU/T2DM without DFU and ulcer type classification.","In the present study, we used four different machine learning algorithms for constructing the prediction models for discriminating T2DM with DFU and T2DM without DFU groups and further ulcer type classification. With respect to performance evaluation metrics, the developed prediction machine learning models are acceptable. The present study demonstrated the application of machine learning algorithms in classifying patients with diabetic foot ulcer and diabetic without foot ulcer categories. Further machine learning algorithms proved to be useful in discriminating the ulcer categories present among the patients with diabetic foot ulcer. The current research also addressed the classifier bias due to imbalanced nature of dataset by application of an oversampling technique. The confusion matrices for the machine algorithms for stage 1 and stage 2 are provided as Supplementary Table 4a and 4b. A stacking ensemble is implemented which subsequently resulted in higher performance evaluation metrics both in I and II stages of classification. The higher performance evaluation metrics as achieved by stacking ensembles can be attributed to the different base classifiers making errors in different regions of the input feature space and compensating for each otherÕs weaknesses. The top five features that contributed in predicting T2DM with DFU were IL-10, FPG, Apo A1, neuropathy, low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides. IL-10 is primarily considered to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine that activates M2 macrophage and promotes wound healing by dampening inflammation and stimulating extra cellular matrix formation like collagen [34]. Similar to our study, other research work has shown DFU patients have decreased expression of IL-10 at keratinocytes and endothelial cells at the wound margin [35]. IL-10 suppresses IL-17-induced inflammation; hence, reduction in IL-10 may contribute to the development of chronic non-healing foot ulcers. Human and cell culture studies have also shown high glucose to be associated with reduced intracellular signal transduction through STAT3, resulting in hypo responsiveness to IL-10 [36]. Thus, there is diminished anti-inflammatory IL-10 functioning resulting in greater chance of formation of DFU in T2DM. Apo A1 has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory role [37]. This protein has been shown to inhibit dendritic cell differentiation and maturation and modulate innate and inflammatory immune response by attenuating Th1 and Th17 responses [38]. Long-term hyperglycaemia causes metabolic disorders which causes the activation of the polyol pathway, with glucose being reduced to sorbitol and damaging the Schwann cells of the axons. Associated endothelial cell dysfunction ensues with decrease in pro-angiogenic factors and reduction in nitric acid production [39]. Dyslipidaemia of low HDL and increased triglycerides which are characteristic of diabetic foot ulcers have been shown to be associated with DFU [40]. After categorizing the ulcers based on WagnerÕs classification, diastolic blood pressure, uric acid, post prandial plasma glucose, sex, low-density lipoprotein and IL-10 were the top five features that helped in discriminating between different ulcer grades. Patients of diabetes with DFU have shown microvascular endothelial dysfunction and increased large vessel stiffness. Thus, vascular complications due to hypertension can be attributed as an important contributor of DFU [41]. The linking of uric acid to diabetic foot ulcers has been studied in few reported research work who have found uric acid to be an independent risk factor to assess the development of diabetic foot [42, 43]. Uric acid promotes inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and also inhibits insulin pathway resulting in macro and microangiopathy and neuropathy [43]. Similar to our study male gender was a risk factor for the severity of ulcers [44,45,46]. Deranged blood glucose evidenced by HbA1c is an indirect measure of plasma glucose level and is a known risk factor for DFU severity and amputation [45] and so post prandial blood glucose is a risk factor for increasing severity of ulcer. Although we have previously mentioned dyslipidaemia to be risk factor for DFU, low-density lipoprotein individually has not been found to be an indicator of severity. IL-10, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, is lowered in DFU indicates lack of immunosuppressive effects. Although few other cytokines have been studied in DFU, we found no literature indicating its association with severity of DFU. However, DFU models have shown that impaired wound healing in diabetics is due to decline of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10[46]. Thus, IL-10 and Apo A1 show promising results with severity of DFU; however, conclusive comments can only be implicative with larger cohorts."
36921649,Machine Learning Predicts Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Diabetes: The Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project,"We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for predicting cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with diabetes (DM). This was a prospective, observational study where clinical data of patients with diabetes hospitalized in the diabetology center in Poland (years 2015-2020) were analyzed using ML. The occurrence of new CV events following discharge was collected in the follow-up time for up to 5 years and 9 months. An end-to-end ML technique which exploits the neighborhood component analysis for elaborating discriminative predictors, followed by a hybrid sampling/boosting classification algorithm, multiple logistic regression (MLR), or unsupervised hierarchical clustering was proposed. In 1735 patients with diabetes (53% female), there were 150 (8.65%) ones with a new CV event in the follow-up. Twelve most discriminative patients' parameters included coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke, diabetic foot disease, chronic kidney disease, eosinophil count, serum potassium level, and being treated with clopidogrel, heparin, proton pump inhibitor, and loop diuretic. Utilizing those variables resulted in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.62 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.56-0.68, P < 0.01) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.77, P < 0.01) across 5 nonoverlapping test folds, whereas MLR correctly determined 111/150 (74.00%) high-risk patients, and 989/1585 (62.40%) low-risk patients, resulting in 1100/1735 (63.40%) correctly classified patients (AUC: 0.72, 95% CI 0.66-0.77). ML algorithms can identify patients with diabetes at a high risk of new CV events based on a small number of interpretable and easy-to-obtain patients' parameters.","The principal findings of our study are 3-fold: (1) we determined the most discriminative patientsÕ parameters which can be exploited to build supervised and unsupervised ML models for identifying diabetic patients with a high risk of a CV event, (2) we showed, following a rigorous multifold cross validation, that a ML algorithm can generalize well over unseen patients while exploiting only 12 interpretable and easy-to-obtain predictors (CAD, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke, DFD, CKD, eosinophil count, serum potassium level, and being treated with clopidogrel, heparin, proton pump inhibitor, and loop diuretic), and (3) we proved better clinical utility of the ML models when compared to the Òtreat allÓ and Òno treatmentÓ strategies. Determining such high- and lowrisk patients is extremely important in relation to precision medicine to discriminate patients that should be treated immediately for avoiding future CV events. The ML supervised RUSBoost model operating on 12 most discriminative features achieved high stability across five nonoverlapping test folds (Fig 1B), with the AUC values ranging from 0.62 to 0.72. This model outperformed its counterpart exploiting all patientsÕ parameters (which would be much more challenging to capture and analyze in the clinical settings), obtaining AUC between 0.63 and 0.68 (Fig 1A), clearly indicating the importance of appropriate feature selection. This is further manifested while building a RUSBoost model operating over 30 patientsÕ parameters which are significantly different (P < 0.05) across the patients with and without a CV event (Table 1)Ñexploiting such a model does not bring any improvements when compared to the one built upon 12 predictors, with AUC ranging from 0.62 to 0.70. The MLR model fitted over 12 predictors offered high discriminative power with AUC of 0.72 over all patients, and it is unlikely to overfit while exploiting such a small number of predictors (Fig 1C). Unsupervised clustering further demonstrated that the selected features allow for grouping the diabetic patients into high- and lowrisk ones (Fig 1H), characterized by significantly different parameter values in such separate clusters (Table 3). Patients at a higher risk of CV events are those who present with history of CVD, namely CAD, peripheral artery disease, stroke and heart failure, which is observed at the level of individual feature analysis (Table 1). CAD, peripheral artery disease, stroke and heart failure are significantly different for the groups of patients with and without an event (P < 0.05). This clearly shows that the highest risk is present in patients who are affected with atherosclerotic vascular disease at each main vascular site (heart, brain, lower extremities) and heart failure as well. Diabetes per se is an important risk factor for HF and often HF is the first CVD diagnosed in patients with T2DM.21 In the considered cohort, significantly more patients with T2DM are present in the group with a CV event, when compared to those without it. Moreover, a concomitant disease, namely CKD, became a significant discriminator of patients with future CV events. CKD is one of the risk factors which should be systematically assessed (at least annually) in all patients with diabetes for prevention and management of both atherosclerotic CVD and HF.22 Among several diabetes-related parameters such as HbA1c, mean glycemia, diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and diabetes duration, only DFD was distinguished by NCA. However, patients with DFD has been recently found to be at the highest risk of future fatal events,23 and there exist estimates proving that the life expectancy of patients with DFD is similar to people with cancers like colon or breast.24 The inflammatory background of coronary atherosclerosis is suggested by higher eosinophil counts which was discriminative to distinguish patients with future CV events. High eosinophil counts were associated with an increased serum fibrinogen and platelet counts, and an increased risk and severity of coronary atherosclerosis.25 This is confirmed in our cluster analysis, where the eosinophil count was higher in patients in the high-risk group (Table 3). Maintaining potassium within a reference range is very important especially in relation to new cardioprotective and renoprotective therapies that can promote potassium retention.26 Indeed, there is a continuous U-shaped relationship between serum potassium and all-cause mortality in the total population and in patients with HF, CKD, diabetes, as well as all 3 diseases and even in patients without these diseases.27 In a population-based analysis, serum potassium concentration ³5.0 mEq/L was associated with all-cause mortality, CVD death, and non-CVD death, and of note, all-cause mortality was also increased among patients with serum potassium levels within the normal range, being 4.0-4.9 mEq/L.28 In our study, the concentration of potassium significantly differentiates diabetic patients with and without an event, and the potassium levels were one of the most discriminative predictors by NCA. Pharmacotherapy has a discriminative effect. Heparin, clopidogrel, loop diuretics, and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were used more frequently by patients with high risk of CV events. Though no causal inference can be made from this study, utilizing those drugs most likely does not increase a risk per se, but were rather drugs that are prescribed more often for patients with more comorbidities. For example, patients who recently had myocardial infarction and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention often take both clopidogrel and PPI. Likewise, those with HF are treated with loop diuretics. Moreover, these drugs are inseparably related to CAD or HF, and we demonstrate their utility as predictors of CV events. There are important limitations of our study. This was a single center study so we cannot generalize the outcomes for the whole population of patients with diabetes. The study is observational in its design. Diagnosis of new onset heart failure was made according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines,29 yet it was somewhat limited due to inaccessibility of natriuretic peptides measurements. This concerned especially heart failure with preserved ejection which cases might have been under recognized. Despite the fact that heart failure is a clinical syndrome with distinct phenotypes, we did not categorize patients based on ejection fraction in this study."
37037162,A machine learning-based diagnosis modelling of type 2 diabetes mellitus with environmental metal exposure,"Increasing and compelling evidence has been proved that urinary and dietary metal exposure are underappreciated but potentially modifiable biomarkers for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aims of this study were (1) to identify the key potential biomarkers which contributed to T2DM with effective and parsimonious features and (2) to assess the utility of baseline variables and metal exposure in the diagnosis of T2DM. Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we selected 9822 screening records with 82 significant variables covering demographics, lifestyle, anthropometric measures, diet and metal exposure for this study. Combining extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest and light gradient boosting machine (lightGBM), a soft voting ensemble model was proposed to measure the importance of 82 features. With this soft voting ensemble model and variance inflation factor (VIF), strong multicollinear features with low importance scores were further removed from candidate biomarkers. Then, a soft voting ensemble classifier was adopted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feature selection method. With the novel feature selection method, 12 baseline variables and 3 metal variables were selected to detect patients at risk for T2DM in our study. For metal variables, the dietary copper (Cu), urinary cadmium (Cd) and urinary mercury (Hg) metals were selected as the most remarkable metal exposure and the corresponding P-values were all less than 0.05. In a classification model of T2DM with 12 baseline biomarkers, the addition of 3 metal exposure improved the classification accuracy of T2DM from a traditional area under the curve (AUC) 0.792 of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to an AUC 0.847. This was the first demonstration of T2DM classification with machine learning under urinary and dietary metal exposure. Improved prediction precision illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning-based diagnosis model facilitated lifestyle/dietary intervention for T2DM prevention.","Since the conjunction of feature selection and the ensemble classifier based on machine learning was a newly emerging method in diabetes research, very few studies have been investigated in this regard. To the best of our knowledge, there existed one study [16] which aimed at the prediction and classification of diabetes with metal exposure of NHANES (2005Ð2016). In [16], both random forest and lasso regression models have been adopted to perform feature selection and prediction of diabetes. An AUC value of 0.78 for the testing set suggested that the latter model possessed a better performance for diabetes classification with 13 non-metallic variables and 4 metal variables. For the sake of fairness, the top 13 baseline variables and the top 4 metal variables were selected with our model, as illustrated in Supplement Figure 1. Note that the classification performance was usually used as an evaluation index of the effectiveness of feature selection. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that our proposed model achieved a high AUC value of 0.85, which was better than the one of 0.78 in [16]. To sum up, the introduction of urinary and dietary metal exposure, the designed feature selection and the classifier provided novel ways to quantify the potential impact of metal exposure on diabetes. The limitations of our study included the following: a) Among the diagnosis and prediction of T2DM with machine learning models, one major concern was the improved accuracy of classification. NHANES can collect a plethora of data, but lack more effective data for the training of classification model, such as genetic data, serum trace metals, and so on. For individual patient data under different databases, it was hard to fuse and cooperate among heterogenous data. b) The novel XRL model was proposed to deal with the discriminating and evaluating for binary classification problems (non-diabetes and diabetes) in our case. However, multi-classification problems (non-diabetes, hyperglycemia and diabetes) are more common for clinical practice. Therefore, future studies would extend this model for multi-classification in diagnosing T2DM. However, these limitations did not alter the fact that the novel feature selection which was based on the machine learning model and a statistical method were worthy of attention in the diagnosis of T2DM."
35612147,The Use of Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Diabetes in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,"The accuracy of the prognosis of diabetes in patients with cystic fibrosis is crucial, as it highly connected with mortality and other complications. The prognosis of diabetes is a time-consuming process. Usually, it is performed by medical staff and can often lead to misdiagnosis. The aim of the study was to analyze and evaluate risk factors of developing diabetes in patients diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis by using classification machine learning techniques. The ECFS data register was used to train and test the models. Visualization of our results using SHAP values highlights that most important features are age, antibiotic treatment, FEV1 value and lung transplant as risk predictors for diabetes.","Cat Boost classification indicates that most important features in patients with both diabetes and CF are age, antibiotic treatment, and lung transplant, as well as FEV1 (Volume of air blown). Same attributes were also most prolific in other models. Our study also highlights the advantage of presenting the results of machine learning with SHAP values which can be also easily understood by non-machine learning experts in our case physicians and other health professionals."
